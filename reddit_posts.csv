1npx601,I picked a stupid fight over a spoon and now we can't stop laughing,0,0.42,7,1758773451.0,True,"Husband [M41] and I [M33] are happily married for about 8 years. We get along really well, have had ups and downs and worked through issues like most couples. So while it's not *unusual* for us to bicker, we've had very few serious fights that's made us reconsider our marriage. 

He brought home an owner-surrender dog recently, on top of the 4 dogs we already have. I was supportive, because he couldn't let this dog be euthanized (which was the owner's only option due to financial constraints). My husband felt a connection with this dog, and he just couldn't put him down (he's a veterinarian). So we've been caring for this critically ill Great Dane after doing the surgery ourselves. 

Husband wanted to feed some honey to this poor dog to help with blood sugar and appetite. He scooped out honey in a long tea spoon, and stuck it in the dog's mouth. I impulsively picked a fight over that. We have a **whole box** of disposable spoons, but he chose a silver long tea spoon. When I tell you that I lost my shit, I'm not kidding. He was snarky too, and said, *""I bring home a dog and dump this on you too, but **this** is what you're mad about?""*

But those were the long tea spoons I always use, daily. And I was horrified by what I witnessed. All logic and reason escaped my brain. I know I can sterilize it. I know it can be used for my needs again. But in that moment, I just couldn't stomach this...thing incident, that is completely meaningless. I pouted and went to bed 

He bought us new long tea spoons off Amazon while pouting to replace that one. And I started laughing. I said, ""*Dude, I know I'm being unreasonable. And this is a really stupid, meaningless fight. But I'm just really upset about that damn spoon and I don't even understand this and I want to fight with you about it.*"" He started giggling and called me crazy, and that he loves me. I started laughing more at my irrationality while acknowledging that I was being unreasonable. But man, I really wanted to fight this guy over a damn spoon. Why couldn't he just get a disposable spoon? 😂

Happily married, and this is the kind of stupid fights we have. Keeps the spice alive, I guess? 😂",funny

I’ve also thought of holy crap, holier than thou, and holy grail but not sure if I could do the crap one appropriateness wise, or holier than thou or holy grail because it’s a public school.

Any more “holy _____ phrases?” Or any other pun ideas in general.

Male mice don’t just squeak—they belt out ultrasonic love songs that are surprisingly sophisticated, full of pitch changes, rhythm, and repeating motifs that can rival birdsongs. Each male has his own signature style, and the ladies often prefer the suitors with the most elaborate tunes. These serenades also have a second purpose, doubling as long-distance communication with males adjusting their songs  depending on how close a female is. This rare  glimpse into the secret serenades of mice shows us that the natural world is often richer than what we can hear or see, full of messages meant for other creatures.",funny

It's harder to make it out in the recording but with headphones on and the Disney+ movie it's isolated to the left ear as the deeper voice man enters on the right.

FOR CLARIFICATION IT WAS NOT HENTAI


My room mates and I were watching some anime, Food Wars to be precise.

Halfway through watching, we got hungry and figured we would order some take out, but all of us were too lazy/ drunk to go get it.

One of my roommates was kind enough to pay for it, as long as I answered the door. Little did I know it would be one of the most embarrassing things I ever did.

For extra clarification, I was wearing a crop top shirt, booty shorts, and some knee high socks because I stole the clothes from my room mates girlfriend, since her and I were really close and I just wanted some comfy clothes to wear and just be goofy in.

I’m also a man.

Once the door rang, in the anime the characters were beginning to taste one of the dishes which was octopus. (Those who have seen the anime know exactly what I’m talking about)

I opened the door also not thinking of my outfit in that moment, as I was purely fixated on eating the hibachi that we ordered.

I shit you not, as SOON as I opened the door, the TV started blaring as the characters on screen tasted the octopus and started hallucinating that they were getting carressed by octopus tentacles and what made it even worse was the TV was pointed directly towards the enterance to the apartment.

The poor girl that answered the door just sat there staring as she handed me the food, taking in my outfit, and whatever the hell we were watching on TV. My room mate also turned up the volume as I said hello, and I couldn’t even make eye contact anymore. I took the food as quickly as possible and shut the door as the girl started dying laughing, and I cussed out my room mate as they were laughing as well.

Food was good though.",funny

1nad0m0,"The ""chipy chein"" guy",35,0.69,5,1757198475.0,True,"

Years ago I worked in a restaurant in Cancún during winter season , 100% Canadian and American tourists.

One of my coworkers was a barback. Nice guy, hard worker, but his English level? Let’s just say… about 20% comprehension on a good day. His “conversations” with customers were basically hand signals, awkward laughs, and wild arm movements that looked like bad tango choreography.

One day management called all bartenders and servers into a meeting. It lasted three hours. During that time, my poor barback coworker was left alone running the bar. We could see him from where we were, interacting with the tourists, and to our surprise… everyone seemed fine. People were laughing, he was laughing, and apparently no major disasters happened (otherwise one of us would have run to save him).

After the meeting I asked him how it went. He was thrilled:

“It was amazing! I got a lot of tips. What I really love is when customers tell me ‘chipy chein.’”

Me: …What the hell is chipy chein? 🤨

Him:
 “Yeah, chipy chein! Like, the bill is 70 dollars, they give me a $100 bill, they say ‘chipy chein’, wave goodbye and leave. So I keep the rest. I think that’s the tip!”

At that point I nearly died laughing. I had to explain:
“Dude, it’s not chipy chein, it’s KEEP THE CHANGE!” 😂

To this day, he’s still working as a barback, still doesn’t speak English… but he’ll never forget the magic words: Chipy Chein.

BUT the issue was when he walked to use the bathroom after throwing back a few, he said that to some actual real cowboys. Like the kind that don’t see people very often. The serious ones. They INSTANTLY swing on him, he swings back. And here I am thinking “god dammit I better go try to break that up”.

1n6ki8p,My mom ordered a toilet plunger through a shopping app and got… this. lol,907,0.9,56,1756822142.0,False,"It was the middle of the night and my mom used one of the apps, oober or doordache or whatever because the toilet was messed up. She asked for a toilet plunger. The driver brought… whatever the hell this thing is! Lmao She texts me like “Wtf is this?! My toilet is gurgling like there’s a fucking monster in it, and this dipshit brought me some kind of toilet gun! It’s a toilet gun! I’m pretty sure I don’t shoot it into the toilet…” and then sent me some pictures. I thought it was hilarious so I helped her fix the toilet and took this thing because I thought it was hilarious. 

My mom is fighting the Eldritch Taco Bell entity from the literal bowels of the earth and some stoned moron brings her a skibidi toilet nerf gun at 2am. The toilet is raging like a poo volcano and she’s swearing about how much of a doofus the driver was. She had a very eventful night. She’s locked in warfare against the first wave of sewage demons and then absolute brain rot finds its way into the physical realm! It’s like my mom was battling Nurgle solo with no backup… stuck going hand to hand against physical putrescence and mental decay all at the same time! She’s a brave warrior!

(P.S. Sorry about the pictures. The framing and angles are weird because the packaging is the most shiny and glossy crap I’ve ever seen! The glare was insane. I couldn’t get it to take a picture without the weird angles. Edit: I can only upload one, but the back of the package is funny too… it’s so stupid. I don’t know what skibidi actually is but there’s a toilet guy with plungers on his face?! Idk..)

P.S.Also, yeah my mom was sleepy and delirious and actually considered for a moment that it was one of those “toilet guns” that you blast down the toilet. She said she considered it for like two seconds. Hahaha 
That makes it even funnier, imagining calling a plumber and there’s a bunch of Skibidi nerf darts mixed into the sewage… “Uhh.. what happened here?” 
“I was fighting for my life, okay!? I didn’t have enough firepower to take down this monster. I needed a real demon slayer to finish the fight!” and my mom is a weeb/nerd so I know she would totally make a joke like that. Haha ",funny

Years later this movie scares me more than I expected",38,0.79,4,1758857172.0,True,"Who could've thought that a story about a rather small incident in a rather small town and community would have such an impact?

With the recent rise of AI and LLMs, we have become used to thinking that very soon there will be a moment when generated music and videos will be completely indistinguishable from reality. And so what? Just trust no one, right?

Well, The Hunt specifically shows what's wrong about this approach. It works only until the moment people want to blame or judge someone. It's only a matter of time until some crime is committed by someone, and 100% AI-generated video or audio will be presented in court as authentic evidence, and no matter the amount of checks and different checking AI tools, no one will be able to truly tell if it's true or false. Cases will be solved entirely up to the judge's intuition and prejudice.

And the worst part is that even if someone is able to distinguish truth from a lie with some tools/genuine evidence, it won't make any difference, as the damage is already done.

  
>!Theo's realization that Lucas wasn't lying, and the fact that Lucas was acquitted in court - all that doesn't matter anymore. Because people have already labeled Lucas as a bad guy, they already hate him and want to kill him. And no actual justifiable evidence will ever change that.

Both actors have a long career almost exclusively playing bad guys. I don't think Danny Houston has ever played a good guy or likable character, and Rufus Sewell really only had Dark City where he got to be a hero. However even that film features most of the supporting cast thinking he is probably a serial killer. They are both handsome and charming actors but it really feels like they are constantly cast as the sneering, smarmy, sociopathic bad guy. Sewell has a Knights Tale, Man in the High Castle, and even most recently played Prince Andrew in Scoop. Danny Houston has been the bad guy in X-men, Wonder Woman, The Crow, and even the recent Naked Gun. Come on hollywood you have the chance to do the funniest thing. ",movies

She got involved with an American and needed her government papers to show she was of good character, but she knows what the files will say about her.  She went to the records office and tried to steal her papers, but was caught by the clerk.  The twist was the records clerk understands her situation, so when he makes her a copy, he omits her black mark giving her a clean paper.

1nqwnd6,The Founder messed with my expectations — but maybe that’s the point,0,0.5,0,1758878283.0,True,"I know this movie came out back in 2016, so I might be really late to the party and maybe people have discussed this to death already. But I just watched *The Founder* recently, and it’s been stuck in my head — not in the way I expected.

I went in thinking it would be like *Ford v Ferrari* or other business/biopic films — something that would fire me up to chase my dream, grind harder, and “think big.” Instead, I left feeling conflicted, almost… disturbed.

The movie doesn’t give us the classic underdog hero arc. Instead, it tells the story from Ray Kroc’s perspective — the “bad guy” — and doesn’t really punish him or give us a moment of balance. The McDonald brothers, who dreamed small but built something pure, end up losing. And then the movie just… leaves it there. No closure, no “fairness,” just a bitter taste.

But maybe that’s the point. The more I think about it, the more I see *The Founder* as a philosophical thought experiment rather than a motivational business story.

* Ray = restless ambition, never satisfied.
* Dick & Mac = contentment, control, saying “no” to anything that would threaten their small dream.

Neither is inherently right or wrong — but the film forces us to sit with the sting of ambition overpowering contentment. Historically, the brothers got $1 million each, which was life-changing for men who never dreamed of an empire. But the movie chooses not to show that angle, probably to make the betrayal feel sharper and push us to reflect on the cost of ambition.

So instead of leaving motivated, I left with a kind of philosophical conflict: Do you dream small and protect what you have, or dream big and risk becoming a Ray Kroc?",movies

Richard Gere plays a dying iconoclastic documentarian and famous draft-dodger, who agrees to a final interview with a pair of his former students but then proceeds to hijack their documentary for his own brand of confession.

Sounds like a laugh a minute, I know. 

But hey, it’s only 90 of those minutes. And Richard Gere as narrator is a revelation. His voice is simultaneously graveled and mellifluous, with almost an Anderson lilt.

I put it in for a rewatch the other day and the opening sequence alone immediately drew me in again. It’s not Schrader’s best work (shout-out to Light Sleeper and First Reformed) but there’s always something interesting in his camera movements and his music selection. Everything is so intentional, you can just feel it. Maybe you’re simply watching Michael Imperioli and his assistant set up the room for filming, but Schrader somehow makes it oddly evocative and emotionally complex, like nostalgia and possibility at the same time.

He has made tons of action films, a bunch of horror films, thrillers, comedies, dramas etc. he has made huge blockbuster Hollywood films, and extremely low budget direct to video movies, and everything in between.

1nq5dr8,Nonsensical trials and rulings in movies,5,0.57,42,1758803198.0,True,"Lots of movies have court scenes. Movies often take a lot of liberties with the procedures of trials in order to make things less boring and more cinematic. But sometimes the liberties go a bit too far and the trial leads to nonsensical results that wouldn't happen in a normal court, often because they go against the law and precedent.

Sometimes, it's intentional, we're meant to see that the system is being rigged, either to protect the rich and powerful, or to oppress marginalized minorities. But usually, no such commentary is being made, we're just meant to assume that this is a normal court operating in a normal manner making a perfectly normal and legal ruling.

For example, in Con Air, Nicolas Cage's character clearly killed some thugs in self-defense to protect his wife, but the Judge despite accepting this premise throws the book at him anyway because he thinks that his military training means that he should be held to higher standards.

In Nightmare on Elm Street, Freedy Krueger gets away with murdering 20 children because “someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place.” In reality, not only would this not invalidate the search as long as the Judge still testifies that he authorized the warrant, it wouldn't matter because as long as the cops believed that the warrant was valid, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine doesn't apply. Not to mention, there was far more evidence than just what was found in Freddy's house, including multiple witnesses. One of the few things I will credit the remake for is that they didn't bother with this plot point, the parents took revenge on Freddy before there even was a trial.

And then there's The Untouchables, where the judge finds out that the jury was bribed by Al Capone (which actually happened), so he just tells the jury from the courtroom next to them to switch places in the middle of a trial (which definitely isn't how that happened and is very much illegal). This causes Al Capone's lawyer to change his plea from not guilty to guilty without even consulting his client (again, obviously very illegal and didn't happen).

So what other court scenes and rulings in movies do you think went way too far in being too unrealistic?",movies

Let me just say I love Sam Raimi and The Evil Dead Franchise is one of my favorite franchises ever, but I kind of hated this movie. Here are a couple reasons of why I feel so negative towards it. 
1. It feels so aimless: I understand the plot but it just kind of felt like half the movie was padding, like the amount of time with actual plot happening felt like less than half the movie, istg.
2. It feels TOO Evil Dead: like I said before, I LOVE Evil Dead, but this movie feels like an Evil Dead ripoff lowkey, I understand Sam has his style of directing, and that's not what im talking about. I more so mean the Evil spirit tormenting innocent character, and lots of blood fountains, and talking goat instead of talking deer, aaandd down to the possessions having similar makeup to the deadites.
3. The CGI is god awful: I understand it was 2009 but oh my god some of the cgi was laughable, I always prefer practical, and that's one of the reasons I love Evil Dead, but this movie had certain scenes where the cgi is so blatant and so bad that it completely pulled me out. (Im looking at you ""throwing up a kitten scene"")
4. It feels SO GODDAM mean spirited: like I said before both Evil Dead and this movie have innocent leads going through horrible things, but this one just feels mean, it's not fun like Evil Dead. I just felt bad for Christine the entire movie as she tries everything and achieves nothing, and dont get me started on the fucking ending. I like depressing or ""bad"" endings, in movies when they are earned or feel like a satisfying end to the theme of the movie, but this movies ending is just, innocent girl gets bad stuff done to her and suffers a horrible fate for no reason. There is no arc, there is no climatic ending, there is no satisfying feeling, its just depressing because shock value.
I dunno thank you for reading my rant, i was honestly disappointed because ive heard good things about this movie and Sam Raimi doesn't miss normally, but alas ig not every one can be a win.",movies

Some Reviews:

[Slashfilm - BJ Colangelo](https://www.slashfilm.com/1626527/shelby-oaks-review/) \- 8 / 10

>It's clear that Chris Stuckmann loves horror and has taken his years of determining what he likes and what he thinks ""works"" by reviewing films on YouTube to shape his craft. At no point does it feel like ""Shelby Oaks"" is anything other than the very best version of what he intended to make, as opposed to the numerous films by first-time feature filmmakers who spend too much time trying to make something they *think* they're supposed to make. The result is a deeply unsettling view that never loses its sense of heart or humanity. With Sullivan's phenomenal performance and Stuckmann's keen eye, ""Shelby Oaks"" allows us to witness the start of one of the most promising new voices in horror.

[Gizmodo - German Lussier](https://gizmodo.com/shelby-oaks-puts-a-satisfying-scary-spin-on-the-found-footage-genre-2000661720)

>This is a horror film for and by the YouTube generation: one that’s inspired by many horror films of the past, with little regard for when or how to borrow from them. As long as it’s cool and scary. Which *Shelby Oaks* is.

[Polygon - Jake Kleinman](https://www.polygon.com/shelby-oaks-review-chris-stuckmann/)

>Overall, Stuckmann’s directorial debut is a sturdy horror movie from a lover of film who clearly understands the genre. While the involvement of indie distributor Neon and producer Mike Flanagan must have gone a long way (For a sense of what the original version of *Shelby Oaks* was like, you can read the mostly positive reviews from its initial premiere at 2024’s Fantasia International Film Festival), there’s strong evidence of talent — and cinematic depravity — to be seen.

>Stuckmann is a smart dude, and one has to admire the commitment to getting this film made. He’ll bounce back, especially given he’s now been given a thumbs-up by Neon. He was also smart enough to give character actor Keith David a movie-stealing scene as the former prison warden who tells Mia about how his facility went to shit and how one of his inmates might have been possessed. A movie about a guy trying to run a haunted prison might have felt more original than this retread. Maybe they can explore that idea in the sequel. At least it’s a new one.",movies

What I don't get is how it accounts for two of the top three grossing films of all time, with another one coming up that's also presumably going to be massive. Just watched the new trailer and it looks goofy as all hell to me (not dissimilar to the first two films). And that's fine - I will openly admit that my tastes don't align with the popcorn swilling mainstream all the time (ahem, Avengers). 

But what I really don't get about Avatar is: I've never met anybody who says they're a fan. I'm not talking Star Wars/Trek like cultish fans; I mean not even a casual fan. Words I've never heard spoken out loud: ""Avatar? Oh sure - I love Avatar!""

Came home and asked my kids and a group of their friends (12 \~ 16 years old) and they were like ""Ava-what now?"" Only one of the group had even seen one of films.

This March, I finally saw Godzilla Minus One.

I’d been meaning to for a year, after catching a clip of the boat chase. Having only seen Godzilla ’98 prior, Minus One hooked me on the franchise.

I’d heard it was a prequel to the ’54 original. (Turns out, not quite.) But that led me to Criterion’s 4K release. Drawn in, I proceeded with the Showa era set and followed through with the rest of the Godzilla canon. Still curious, I watched every other major kaiju film, including proto-kaiju and kaiju-adjacent entries.

These are my notes on that journey, including my tier rankings. If I seem contrarian, just know I was totally ignorant of consensus. And if this all seems like self-indulgent bullshit, hey, don't read it, whatever.

All in all, I loved this experience and will be a Godzilla fan for life.

**The Terror of Western Godzilla: 2014 vs. Minus One**

One thing I learned watching 130-some hours of kaiju:

In a character-driven story, the central conflict needs resonate within the protagonist. Otherwise, it’s just stuff happening.

To say it another way: in order to transcend being just an FX monster that smashes fake buildings, Godzilla must mean something to our leads.

That’s why I opted to include *The Host* in my rankings despite it not being strictly a kaiju film. In addition to being a noted influence on *Godzilla Minus One*, it exemplifies a character-driven monster story. Our leads have clear stakes tied to the monster. The unfolding conflict illuminates our leads to us and their relationships with one another. Because the plot and emotional context move as one, the action’s climax is received and felt on an emotional level.

This kind of thematic monster story is something Steven Spielberg (a student of Japanese cinema) does very well. Consider *Jurassic Park*. Alan Grant doesn’t just save a couple kids. Instead, he overcomes his aversion to kids, discovers something noble in himself, and leaves the island greater than he arrived. *Godzilla Minus One* operates in that same tradition.

When Godzilla lands at Ginza, Koichi is forced to confront the same monster that caused him to choke in fear years earlier. His desperation to save Noriko shows his transformation into someone ready to act despite mortal terror, specifically for his chosen family. After Noriko is swept away, the loss compounds his guilt and drives his determination in the final confrontation with Godzilla. What's more, we're left to wonder if he'll choose to live despite this grief.

Contrast this with the sequence from *Godzilla 2014,* in which Ford Brody (woof) saves the abandoned boy on the train. There, the situation resolves with Brody totally unaffected. Despite opportunities around his mother's death, his estranged father, or his own family, the film never invests in emotional stakes. Even when Ford's military expertise becomes useful, it's devoid of emotional weight. After Act I, our lead's story doesn't intersect meaningfully with the monster conflict. The result is a face-melting CG climax in the service of nothing.

This refusal to engage us plagues Legendary’s MonsterVerse. Their next Godzilla film swings so hard in the opposite direction its theme becomes unrelatable. *King of the Monsters’* eco-terrorist question of erasing humanity to save the planet gestures at a philosophical dilemma, but it never roots the question in relatable human experience.

Japanese kaiju explores themes of real, shared cultural anxieties like nuclear trauma, the shame of occupation, chemical pollution, or the pitfalls of bureaucracy. If western kaiju can muster a theme at all, it hides behind banal, supervillain, blockbuster tropes.

I know that films don't all need to be Spielbergian monster-as-daddy stories. *Shin Godzilla* succeeds by taking a different approach (exploring the response of human systems). *Destroy All Monsters* succeeds as campy fun. And hey, it’s great! I love the Showa era. But if a storyteller wants me to relate emotionally to its characters, all the Dolby Vision and Atmos in the world won’t substitute for a resonant theme and relatable stakes.

That’s why *Minus One* lured me into the genre and why it deserves the acclaim. It proves stories are still powerful and that the fundamentals still matter.

Having said all that, I also enjoy ridiculous Tokusatsu suitmation adventures! Which leads me to…

**Horror of the Zeitgeist: Tokusatsu vs. CG**

For most modern viewers, Tokusatsu films will bounce off their eyeballs as ludicrous and primitive relics from before CG. Nothing more than fodder for *Mystery Science Theater 3000*. But when I engaged with them on their own terms, something clicked. The magic isn’t in realism. It’s in craft and participation.

Some moments where my love of the genre took root:

·       Mothra’s twin larvae racing across the sea to blast Godzilla with silk

·       The gang curb-stomping Ghidorah in *Destroy All Monsters*

·       Hedorah sucking exhaust from a factory smokestack

·       Mechagodzilla soaring past Godzilla and peppering him with missiles

·       The epic finale of the original *Daimajin*

These scenes invite you to play along. As with pro wrestling, Tokusatsu runs on kayfabe. You know it’s a guy in a suit. You know the buildings are miniatures. But if you can engage with the illusion, the payoff can become real.

The Showa era feels magical to me because it wasn’t embarrassed to be Tokusatsu. The Heisei era, by contrast, seemed darker and more self-serious, as if trying to shed its own silly legacy. (I understand there were more complex cultural factors of the era I’m not an expert on.) The Millennium era felt even more detached, willing to sacrifice character legacy to chase contemporary tastes. Though Tokusatsu remained the medium, its tone wavered as the cultural zeitgeist shifted.

Toho’s reaction to *Godzilla ’98* seems a flashpoint. Maybe it was the redesign. Maybe the story. Maybe the box office. But I wonder if it wasn’t the CG. (After all, they parodied it in *Final Wars*, as if reclaiming the joke.)

Watching the films chronologically, I detected a shift once I crossed the CG threshold. My tolerance for weak stories and dull characters dropped. It seems when the suits and miniatures are gone, I stop playing along as willingly. I start asking what all this spectacle is in service of.

Maybe it's just the novelty of an antique era? Today, competent CG is now a baseline expectation. Suitmation never was. Its novelty is inexhaustible, as is its humanity. You can feel the fingerprints on every frame. (To be fair though, I’m not excited by lame Tokusatsu either.)

In the end, I guess what makes a film prescient is how it arrives in the zeitgeist of its era. And not just in its FX. Some of the Godzilla Tokusatsu films are exemplars of their era. The MonsterVerse CG films just aren’t.

In 2024, *Godzilla Minus One* earned Toho the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, signaling they’re once again operating at the forefront of the technical zeitgeist. The Tokusatsu-inspired CG of that film feels like the culmination of a tradition stretching back to Honda and Tsuburaya. I'm sure it felt like quite the achievement for the studio, and proves that Tokusatsu was always an important language in the evolution of filmmaking.

**Me vs. Consensus**

After ranking the Godzilla canon, I compared my list to others. It was interesting to note the discrepancies.

**Things I didn’t enjoy as much as consensus:**

* **GMK** – The characterizations felt off. Why use Mothra if it’s not fully Mothra? Why use Ghidorah if it’s not really Ghidorah? They felt more like arbitrary selections than intentional deconstructions.
* **Godzilla vs. Destoroyah** – I just couldn’t get wrapped up in it. It felt like an event that I wasn't in on. Will revisit someday.
* **Aliens and Ghidorah** – I don’t prefer the alien stories. They just felt like ways to get Ghidorah on the screen. On that note, Ghidorah doesn’t feel grounded or well-conceived to me. For contrast, Hedorah has a thematic design that suits its backstory. A species arrived by comet and evolved in chemical pollutants? I get it. But a bulbous three-headed dragon from space just wasn’t for me.
* **Heisei Gamera** – Oversold to me in advance. While impressive for its era and clearly an FX revolution, the attempt to bring weight to the character struck me as flat and joyless overall. The second film made me wonder if I’d just seen too many kaiju military efforts by that point.

**Some things I enjoyed more than consensus:**

* **Gamera the Brave** – I was expecting it to be bad, but as a family film, it worked and had a satisfying conclusion. Probably the best kids/family kaiju movie I watched.
* **Godzilla vs. Hedorah** – I grew up on *Mad Magazine*, pot, and the Beatles, so this was a big hit for me. I plan to watch it again as soon as possible.
* **Son of Godzilla** – The campy monster story contrasted well with the survivalist human drama. The other island monsters were great. It felt well-conceived all around, despite some goofy design.
* **Ebirah, Horror of the Deep** – I liked the setup of the guys stowing away with the criminal. Their infiltration scheme was decent. They all had something to contribute. The water fights were cool. He rips the guy’s claw off and waves it at him. Come on.
* **The War of the Gargantuas** – This stands out as the most MST3K-worthy film of them all. It’s a blast to watch with others because it’s exceedingly campy and ridiculous. “Frankenstein’s ghost has apparently been eating some people.” Okay then. (Bonus: It stars Dr. Jacoby for you Twin Peaks fans.)

**Extra Gushing**

* **Rodan** – The standalone *Rodan* film is great. Awesome to see a color Showa film that retains a horror tone. Well-paced. The aerial stuff is great and unique. The ants were bad, but *Rodan* remains one of the best Showa kaiju films.
* **Mothra and the Shobijin/Cosmos** – I adore Mothra. The mythos, design, and character are spectacular. The Peanuts are icons. Love the musical summoning component.
* **The Kiryu Saga** – I appreciated the quality of these two films. They weren’t outrageous and didn’t swing as hard as other entries, but were well done, compelling, and had satisfying action.
* **Akira Ifukube** – Some of this music is incredible. The opening title theme of *Rodan* is otherworldly. Big fan.

**Origin Stories**

In conclusion: a kaiju film is like a kaiju itself.

The best ones have profound origins, born from fear, satire, grief, or joy. They’re distinct in design, combining familiar elements into something bold and unforgettable. They have a silhouette that reads like a signature.

Each succeeds or fails on the strength of its own identity. Some are nightmares, manifesting our collective anxieties. Some reflect our notions of heroism. Some make us cheer. Some make us laugh. And some are lovably ridiculous without apology.

Of course, some are forgettable. Some are manufactured. And some are abominations we should stuff into the core of the planet.

But the fact that kaiju films can succeed across such a diversity of approaches suggests there are still frontiers left to raid. My hope for the genre’s future is to see giant monsters storm them all.

**My Rankings**

Note: I haven't revisited or scrutinized my comments here, so I preemptively disown them.

**S-Tier (Ranked)**

3. **King Kong** (1933, *RKO*) – A work of vision with incredible animation that creates a legend from thin air.
4. **Godzilla** (1954, *Toho*) – Vision and theme elevate B-movie subject to sublime effect. A genre is born.
5. **The Host** (2006, *Chungeorahm*) – Not totally kaiju, but an outstanding monster film that modernizes the genre and influences kaiju to come.

**A-Tier (Ranked)**

1. **Godzilla vs. Hedorah** (1971, *Toho*) – Godzilla's hippie freakout is a blast. Well-developed challenger in Hedorah.

3. **Mothra vs. Godzilla** (1964, *Toho*) – The first time the vs. formula really works. Match made in Heaven.
4. **Rodan** (1956, *Toho*) – Kaiju still operating as horror. Transcends the era.
5. **Godzilla vs. Mothra** (1992, *Toho*) – A return to form that still works.

**B-Tier (Ranked)**

1. **Godzilla vs. Biollante** (1989, *Toho*) – Singular mood among the films, with intriguing threat and great human characters.
2. **Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla** (2002, *Toho*) – More effective and sincere than others in goofy Millennium era.
3. **Destroy All Monsters** (1968, *Toho*) – Silly? Yes. Fun? Definitely. Great action sequences. Great kaiju selection.
4. **The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms** (1953, *Warner*) – Proto Godzilla shines in stunning city destruction with great animation.
5. **Godzilla vs. Megaguirus** (2000, *Toho*) – A romp that has fun with itself in Godzilla's awkward era.
6. **Son of Godzilla** (1967, *Toho*) – Compelling kaiju action despite the goofy little guy with decent human storyline.
7. **Ebirah, Horror of the Deep** (1966, *Toho*) – One of the best human character ensembles and story with good action sequences.
8. **Mothra** (1961, *Toho*) – Feels classic and essential immediately and doesn't disappoint.
9. **Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla** (1974, *Toho*) – The Showa era tries for a more mature sci-fi story after too much kid crap. Mechagodzilla rules.

**C-Tier (Ranked)**

1. **Godzilla vs. Megalon** (1973, *Toho*) – Jet frickin' Jaguar. It's a fun one and the best example of Godzilla as camp.
2. **King Kong** (2005, *Universal*) – Jackson's competent if bloated Kong is fine.
3. **Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) – Incredible final ten minutes. Slow and dull buildup.
4. **Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II** (1993, *Toho*) – A cool entry for Mechagodzilla with status quo human drama.
5. **Gamera the Brave** (2006, *Kadokawa*) – Better-than-expected family film with a great third act.
6. **Gamera: Guardian of the Universe** (1995, *Daiei*) – Overrated, dry, and too serious, but outstanding effects.
7. **The Return of Godzilla** (1984, *Toho*) – Self-conscious reboot, not as much fun as it should've been.
8. **Them!** (1954, *Warner*) – Stylish and cool for its day. Drags in the second half.
9. **Godzilla vs. Destoroyah** (1995, *Toho*) – Grim spectacle and not much fun. Finale didn't seem to earn impact. Confusing opening. 1954 tie-ins interesting.
10. **Gamera vs. Barugon** (1966, *Daiei*) – The most entertaining Showa era Gamera, but this schtick won't hold.
11. **Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster** (1964, *Toho*) – Hokey alien storyline with a repeat climax from *Mothra vs. Godzilla*.
12. **Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris** (1999, *Daiei*) – Another dour Gamera entry that begs you to believe.
13. **The War of the Gargantuas** (1966, *Toho*) – Bad overall, but the most fun flick in its tier. Good for viewing with friends.
14. **Shin Ultraman** (2022, *Toho/Khara*) – Great to look at. Fun at first. Storyline wears.
15. **Pacific Rim** (2013, *Legendary*) – Mech action film using kaiju. Bogged down by its own lore. Wanted to love it, but was exhausted by it.
16. **Godzilla Raids Again** (1955, *Toho*) – Over-hated Godzilla sequel with some fun human performances.
17. **Frankenstein vs. Baragon** (1965, *Toho*) – All kaiju movies should aspire to be this strange.
18. **Terror of Mechagodzilla** (1975, *Toho*) – Decent, but the human storyline feels reheated and overwrought.
19. **Gamera the Giant Monster** (1965, *Daiei*) – Competent but unnecessary Godzilla knock-off. Fun novelty.
20. **Gamera 2: Attack of Legion** (1996, *Daiei*) – Middle part of trilogy does nothing to build to its finale. Dull military procedural. Great effects.
21. **King Kong vs. Godzilla** (1962, *Toho*) – Notable for introducing the vs. format, but the action is half-assed and Kong looks terrible.
22. **GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack** (2001, *Toho*) – Treats kaiju as a grab-bag of toys with revisionist lore. Horror tone is unique. Felt more arbitrary than deconstructed.

**D-Tier (Chronological)**

* **Invasion of Astro-Monster** (1965, *Toho*) – Goofy space story with dumb dancing.
* **Gappa** (1967, *Nikkatsu*) – More charm than a lot of these one-off knock-offs, with charismatic actors. Ultimately generic.
* **Gamera vs. Gyaos** (1967, *Daiei*) – Gamera really wearing out his welcome here with this dull challenger.
* **Godzilla vs. Gigan** (1972, *Toho*) – Goofy action, muddled human drama, weird buddy vibes.
* **Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah** (1991, *Toho*) – Incoherent plot drags out overrated nemesis for a weirdly self-conscious Heisei entry.
* **Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla** (1994, *Toho*) – Tedious Miki melodrama. Worst action of the Heisei era?
* **Rebirth of Mothra** (1996, *Toho*) – An attempt at a family film that has some cute moments, but feels unnecessary.
* **GODZILLA** (1998, *TriStar*) – Notoriously bad, yet still gives its characters more weight than the horrible *Godzilla '14*.
* **Cloverfield** (2008, *Paramount*) – Feels like a student film. Can't maintain the found footage aesthetic.
* **GODZILLA: Planet of Monsters** (2017, *Toho*) – Barely a Godzilla/kaiju product. At least trying something.

**F-Tier (Chronological)**

* **Son of Kong** (1933, *RKO*) – WTF is this?
* **The Mysterians** (1957, *Toho*) – Kaiju sounds like an alarm clock.
* **Varan the Unbelievable** (1958, *Toho*) – Half-assed compared to other Toho. Incoherent action sequences.
* **The Giant Behemoth** (1959, *Artistes*) – Dull.
* **Gorgo** (1961, *King Brothers*) – British nautical knock-off of *Godzilla* by way of *King Kong*.
* **Atragon** (1963, *Toho*) – Novel as a Toho film of its era but dull and barely kaiju.
* **Return of Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) – Boring repeat.
* **Wrath of Daimajin** (1966, *Daiei*) – Another boring repeat.
* **The X from Outer Space** (1967, *Shochiku*) – Unremarkable.
* **King Kong Escapes** (1967, *Toho*) – Janky 60s Kong fails. Stupid plot. Looks awful.
* **Gamera vs. Viras** (1968, *Daiei*) – Schlock.
* **All Monsters Attack** (1969, *Toho*) – Stock footage clip show with dopey bullying message.
* **Gamera vs. Guiron** (1969, *Daiei*) – Crap.
* **Space Amoeba** (1970, *Toho*) – Low-mid Toho with no inspiration. Had no patience for this.
* **Gamera vs. Jiger** (1970, *Daiei*) – Bullshit.
* **Gamera vs. Zigra** (1971, *Daiei*) – No.
* **King Kong** (1976, *DEG/Paramount*) – The Dude is not enough to save this weak, dated impression of a timeless classic.
* **The Mighty Peking Man** (1977, *Shaw Bros*) – Almost fun.
* **Gamera: Super Monster** (1980, *Daiei*) – Fart sound.
* **King Kong Lives** (1986, *DEG*) – Torture.
* **Rebirth of Mothra II** (1997, *Toho*) – My eyes crossed trying to stay focused on this.
* **Rebirth of Mothra III** (1998, *Toho*) – Just let it end.
* **Godzilla 2000: Millennium** (1999, *Toho*) – Okay concept, dull execution. Yawn.
* **Godzilla: Final Wars** (2004, *Toho*) – Put down the *Animatrix* and step away from the Godzilla. A tacky nightmare.
* **Godzilla (2014)** (*Legendary*) – Inexcusable to not thematically tie the lead to the monster. Cynical, vacuous flop.
* **Kong: Skull Island** (2017, *Legendary*) – Did someone make this movie at gunpoint? Hollow and dull with trite, forced nostalgia.
* **GODZILLA: City on the Edge of Battle** (2018, *Toho*) – Melodramatic, dull, and not kaiju.
* **GODZILLA: The Planet Eater** (2018, *Toho*) – Let it end, dear god.
* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters** (2019, *Legendary*) – Big budget slop doesn't respect these characters or this genre at all.
* **Godzilla vs. Kong** (2021, *Legendary*) – No heart and no competent storytelling. What am I supposed to be engaged by here?
* **Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** (2024, *Legendary*) – Embarrassing.",movies

Here is **my list of top 5** with explenation why and my favourite movie they made. They arent in order since i concider them on similar level (I would make top 10, but that would become too debatable, not that its a bad thing, just want to be as clear as possible):

*Daniel Day Lewis* (for alot of people obvious choice, and its no surprise, this guy is amazing at his craft and takes it very seriously, sometimes too much) There will be blood

*Chrisoph Waltz* (came out of nowhere, the true supporting actor, him in combination with tarantino is perfection. Similarly to DDL, man of Quality over quantity and the quality can be felt through the roof, easily steals movies as a supporting actor, while not overshadowing the lead or making them look horrible) Inglorious Basterds

*Leo DiCaprio* (man of many talents, lead of plenty excelent movies, been acting on very high level since his teenage years, you dont have to say too much about him, most of poeple seen his movies) Shutter Island

*Denzel Washington* (african american icon and role model, excelent talent, puts hearth and soul into every single role he is in, the recipe for a great movie needs this special ingredient, forget Gladiator 2 tho) Men on Fire

*Tom Hanks* (the favorite of many, can squeez through even the tightest cravice right into persons hearth, no matter what role you put him in, can carry movie as a solo actor, without any support and has movies to prove it) Green Mile

Honorable mention: *Christian Bale* (on par with rest, just not as influential for me like the rest of them, although his dedication for making great movie is unrivalled) American Psycho

  
Two actors that i dont concider great yet, but could become top 5 one day:

Miles Teller (if i skip those movies for teens, most of his work was Intriguing for me) Whiplash

Robert Pattinson (again, skipping teenage movies, guy has massive range on par with the greats) Lighthouse

The list is always debatable, since acting is art and therefor subjective. I can understand most of you will disagree with last two, they are just guys am rooting for and believe they could make amazing legacy still.

1np44yt,Has anyone seen the movie Circle (2015) on Netflix?,32,0.63,70,1758692341.0,True,"HUGE fan of this random-ass film - the concept is highly intriguing and I want to find more stuff like this. 50 people wake up in a strange, dark room (I won’t reveal what or where the room is), and discover that every few minutes they have to vote anonymously to eliminate one person in the group. The cast of characters is diverse in that it includes almost every stereotype (in a good way) - you have a wealthy conservative businessman, an ex con, a pregnant lady, an immigrant, a military grunt, a crafty tech millennial, etc etc etc. It comes across as a contrived social experiment, but they’re voting people to their immediate death so the stakes are pretty damn high. It’s interesting to see all of the different archetypes of people interact/state their case(s)/align with other archetypal characters. 

It’s a simple plot but it’s damn intriguing to me for some reason. I love elimination shows like survivor so maybe that factors in, but either way: I highly recommend this quick watch (it’s MAYBE an hour 20 - similar in length—and tone—to a Black Mirror episode). Especially if you like to see a group of people narrow down until there’s one left. It’s very well-written in my opinion. The direction is what it is - you can’t ask for incredible camera angles or shots in a one-room psychological thriller

1nq20po,"Midsommar [2019]- bold and suttle, does well to contrasts the visually pleasing 'fairytale' aesthetic but with flaws [6.8/10]",0,0.27,7,1758791864.0,True,"I loved the screenplay and the attention to the smaller details that have really added to the whole 'fairytale' setup of the film. Generally I'd love anything with the folklore story type. And I loved how deceiving the whole welcome was and how gradually it built up to the darkness. And the Scandinavian midsummer days perfectly contrasts it. I appreciate the self sustainable and community nature of the whole village and their strong beliefs and everyone sticks to each other.

I loved Dani's character, how disturbed she was and how she tries to avoid the reality of things, prefers to stay in denial of things, convincing herself that it's alright. Her crashouts/panic attacks and her family history added up well to the unsettling theme of it. I don't have much better to say about most of the other characters, I thought they could've played Christian better and Pelle's role wasn't a complete one. And the others were a bit vague too, maybe that's how it is supposed to be, not a fan of their decision making abilities and them not being able to question what could be wrong.

I liked the general slow pacing of the film, there wasn't much unnecessary stuff but it was a bit dragged. It surprised me with the sacrificial cult but I felt at the end it was a bit too forced upon and things went more unpleasant than it should have.

I've seen more critical reviews about Dani's cold hearted hate and how she hid her trueself but I think it makes sense why she would make the decision at the end and also considering her grief and her having a bipolar sister.

Overall, it was a good watch but it underperformed to what my expectations had built up to.",movies
1nq06xv,Which were the last four films you've gazed your eyes on and what are your views on each picture?,0,0.27,8,1758784530.0,True,"**The Trip to Bountiful** - 3 Stars. Geraldine Page enlivens the film with her heartrending performance as Miss Carrie Watts. Her scenes with Rebecca DeMornay are the best ones and I was sad when DeMornay left the picture before the last act. The film does get stagy at times. 

**Black Narcissus** - 4 and a Half Stars. Heart. A visual masterpiece and a film which goes from drama into a suspenseful scary film. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is otherwordly. The majority of the cast is magnificent especially Deborah Kerr and an unforgettably terrifying Kathleen Byron. 

**They Live** - 3 Stars. Roddy Piper does a solid crossover from the WWE into acting. Suspenseful and unpredictable sci-fi thriller with an added social commentary and a touch of humor. I wish Meg Foster had a larger part. Those eyes. I did find Piper's John obsession with Foster's Holly unconvincing and a stretch. The iconic fight scene. 

**A Child Is Waiting** - 2 Stars. John Cassavetes did it for the paycheck, a studio film. As well-intentioned as it was, it's a strictly predictable, corny melodrama about children with disabilities who are rejected by the parents. The most interesting characters are the parents of the lead boy, played by Steven Hill and Gena Rowlands. Judy Garland as the understanding teacher comes off as completely unhinged and unequipped to be a teacher.",movies
1npvz31,Collapse Cinema: today’s best directors are reinventing the end of the world,0,0.33,5,1758769642.0,True,"With the upcoming releases of Eddington by Ari Aster, Bugonia by Yorgos Lanthimos, and One Battle After Another by Paul Thomas Anderson (which I haven’t seen yet and can’t say for sure if it fully belongs), a distinct kind of cinema about the collapse of our civilization is coming into focus—a wave that, to me, began with Don’t Look Up and continued with films like Leave the World Behind, Civil War, and more recently Mountainhead. These films aren’t interested in grand spectacles of destruction or city-level devastation; instead, they dwell on collective anxiety, disinformation, and the paralysis of both elites and ordinary people in the face of real, plausible threats. They portray an intimate apocalypse, where the real drama unfolds inside small groups and confined spaces that serve as microcosms for a society on the brink. This sets them apart from the disaster blockbusters of the 2000s—think 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow—which relied on heroic saviors, massive CGI set pieces, and tidy, reassuring resolutions. They also differ from Black Mirror: while that series shares a taste for technological unease and speculative scenarios, it remains a collection of sci-fi morality plays about gadgets, whereas these films are more ambiguous, atmospheric, and overtly political, staring unflinchingly at the present rather than some imagined future.

I can’t wait to see Eddington, Bugonia, and One Battle After Another, and I’m almost certain they won’t disappoint me. Just watching the trailers is enough to recognize that they belong to this wave of collapse cinema, even though each approaches the idea from its own angle. What’s fascinating is seeing how directors so different yet so influential—arguably some of the most important of their generation—can work with the same contemporary sense of unease and produce such distinct results",movies

1npwbgk,The Irishman is my greatest film oat,0,0.39,17,1758770734.0,True,"It frustrates me when people only tie this movie to the de-aging or claim it was “ too long “ or that they stopped their watch after 20 minutes, and not deep dive into the grand scheme Scorsese portrayed with this. It is a masterpiece. The heavy themes and emotional depth poured into the story left me with a blank emptiness for days on my first watch and the final act of the film is Scorseses best. It’s centered around a man’s slow collapse into nothingness and how he is forced to confront the life that he lived at the very end, not able to process his behavior until he’s been reduced to isolation. Franks actions throughout the movie cost him a relationship with his daughter whom he loved, and the final 45 minutes Frank is forced to live with that, in abandonment and regretfulness, alone with himself and his meaningless “ loyalty “ to the mafia as death is around the corner. That is what the movie is all about imo, the cost of power and how it fades out on you. 


The entire cast killed it. they all had great chemistry. Anna Pacquin’s character had little dialogue yet told everything with her facial expressions aka “ I know what you’ve done “ as Frank cannot hide the truth. Joe Pesci was phenomenal. I think the score and directing was perfectly executed. The pacing is intentionally slow and pays it off with the final 3rd of the movie. It’s unlike any crime film ever made. 

Obviously a hot take, and I’d be very open to opinions or your other favorite movies but I just can’t stand when people give up on this movie so easily, or hold a bias towards it because of the de-aging or that one beating up scene. I can’t find a single true flaw in the storytelling. It’s not a real life accurate movie, but it’s my favorite movie oat.

1npxsow,"My theory on the ending of the 2025 film ""Weapons""",0,0.29,18,1758775578.0,True,"Okay so after finishing Weapons and sitting with that ending, I think people are missing the real twist. Everyone keeps saying, “Gladys is dead, the kids are traumatized but free.” Nah — that doesn’t line up with what we actually see.

Here’s my theory:

Gladys controlled people by breaking twigs plus attaching personal objects (hair, clothes, etc.). That’s her whole ritual. She didn’t “hypnotize” anyone out of thin air — it was physical, object-based witchcraft.

When Alex uses her hair on the twig with his blood and snaps it, he’s not just destroying her spell — he’s using her own magic against her. Which means he learned the process in the traumatizing time he had to spend watching her and taking care of his family and those poor kids. 

In doing so, Alex doesn’t free the kids. He binds them under himself If the same logic applies to when Gladys is doing the blood rituals, he has now accidentally made them his puppets! 

That final shot where the kids are standing silently, catatonic, even after Gladys is torn apart? That’s not “lingering trauma.” That’s them still bound- but this time, to Alex.

So what does that mean?

When Gladys died, her puppets were released.

The same rule applies now: the kids will only be released when Alex dies.

Alex didn’t end the curse, he inherited it. Power didn’t disappear — it transferred.

If that was Cregger’s intent (and given how he loves cycles of abuse, trauma, and power in his work, I’d bet it was), then the ending is way darker than people realize. Alex isn’t the savior — he’s the new Gladys.

What do you all think? I noticed a lot of people saying how the kids were just traumatized but I feel like it's so much deeper than that! I feel Zach had this central theme of power being transferred and that would perfectly fit my claim! ",movies
1nonj9b,"""I'm not a spy! I read books!"" ""Three Days of the Condor""",45,0.77,21,1758648160.0,True,"""Three Days of the Condor"" is a 1975 thriller starring Robert Redford as a bookish CIA analyst who stumbles on a lethal conspiracy and has to run for his life while unraveling the mystery as he goes. I admired the movie and enjoyed watching it, but I was not engaged. 

Redford is cool and handsome. I loved the clothes and cars. The CIA gadgetry is delightfully retro high-tech (transistorpunk). Faye Dunaway is beautiful and warm as Redford's love interest; she effortlessly steals a scene at a New York deli. Max Von Sydow is delicious as a weirdly friendly assassin. The movie also features Cliff Robertson and John Houseman. 

It's a very good New York movie, showing off the gritty city in the 1970s. It's in a category of 1970s New York movies like ""The French Connection"" and early ""Annie Hall."" The movie takes place just before Christmas; director Sidney Pollack made an interesting, smart and realistic choice: There's no snow on the ground, which is often the case in New York over Christmastime. There's almost no discussion of Christmas. You hear some Christmas carols in ambient music and see some Christmas decorations in stores and that's it for the Christmas angle. It takes place over Christmas but it's not a Christmas movie. It's like ""Die Hard"" that way. 

The plot is complicated and confusing. Redford does thriller-movie shtick, using Dunaway as a go-between to deliver a menacing message, getting into brawls and gunfights, racing across town and hacking a phone switching office. He is infinitely resourceful and confounds experienced field agents,  explaining that he learned everything from books. In the end, of course, Redford figures everything out, but I don't know how, and I'm not 100% sure what he figured out. 

Although I enjoyed the movie, it didn't pull me in because it's been overtaken by headlines. The movie premise is that a hypercompetent conspiracy of government agents drives U.S. affairs. In reality today, the government is run by clowns. I wish ""Three Days of the Condor"" were an accurate depiction; instead, we're living in ""Idiocracy.""	

Redford's character's relationship with Dunaway's character is disturbing. She is a stranger whom he kidnaps at random so he can use her as cover to get out of Manhattan and hide out in her apartment. He holds her at gunpoint and ties her up in her own bathroom for hours while he goes out and does spy things. Nonetheless, she decides he's a nice guy and has sex with him. Sometimes I'm shocked by how rapey pop culture was in the 20th Century. 

Sloppy Internet research:

- Redford wears an excellent, preppy wardrobe. He wears a herringbone tweed jacket or a pea-jacket at different times in the movie, over a navy crew-neck sweater, chambray shirt and tie (the crew-neck sweater and tie are not, to be honest, a good look), flared jeans, and hiking boots. [Men's fashionistas have struggled for decades to find that exact tweed jacket.](https://www.ft.com/content/3c1aaf5b-5eb6-4e82-86f9-c114f3ad48c3). The look is iconic, like Steve McQueen's tweed jacket and roll-neck sweater in ""Bullitt,"" which set off a fashion trend for men when that movie was released.   
- The film has been received as a political statement or propaganda, but director Sidney Pollack says it's [just a thriller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Days_of_the_Condor#Reception) — nothing more. It was released at about the same time as a scandal broke in the news about illegal CIA activities; Pollack says the movie was already well underway when the scandal hit, and he is frustrated by people who think he was sending a message. 
- At the beginning of the movie, Redford's character orders lunch for his office from a luncheonette, the [Lexington Candy Shop.](https://www.lexingtoncandyshop.com/) It was founded in 1925, is still in business, and [still looks the same](https://rolandopujol.substack.com/p/at-the-lexington-candy-shop-a-sweet). 
- [Faye Dunaway is still alive and seems to be still working.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Dunaway) I'm happy to see it.

Showing how racism and hate is often twisted and packaged behind pseudo-economic and perceived inequality tinged hatred, and then, how it begins. Learned at home. And throughout the film, you see where that gets you: absolutely nowhere. And the ending is just heart wrenching, the cycle never ends. Highly encourage a rewatch.

But then we have Doc. Roy Scheider's character gets stuck four inches deep with a knife, followed by a twisting further impalement, falls to the ground bleeding profusely, and seems to pass out. Then he apparently walks all the way back to Babe's apartment, before dying seconds after arriving.

* >!Clint is a trained and experienced killer; Sleepy is a professional athlete.!<
* >!Both Clint and Sleepy have lost their significant others that day as a result of the The Guy's actions.!<
* >!In the final infomerical for Psytopics, Sleepy specifically talks about defeating your enemies with your mind alone.!<

I take this to mean that:

It was a kinda good! It actually is a bit misleading, and makes you think the plot revolves around a certain element while it doesn't really focus on that. This is both its strength and its weakness, but it left me quite surprised in a positive way. I was definitely expecting something more extreme from a visual point of view, especially judging from her previous movies. I’ve read about people feeling sick while watching this movie, and I honestly wonder what they felt while watching The Substance. 

Don’t get me wrong: it still is a Ducournau’s movie, so some bits will be pretty gnarly.

I also loved the fact that certain things are not really explained in full detail and you actually have to connect the dots. Even the smallest details (or sentences) are meaningful at a second watch.

It's definitely not a perfect movie... it's very flawed, to be fair! It seems like it tries to talk about so many things... and never really talk about anything in depth. It scratches the surface of a lot of themes, but I felt like it was kinda empty at the end of the movie.",movies

Columbus is I think one of the only perfect films to exist and After Yang is also great. Colin Farrell is one of my favourite actors. I didn’t think it would be as good as those, but I was like surely 7.5/10. The fact it’s got a 30% on RT is just heartbreaking to me lol. 

And his other film Ballad Of A Small Player is also getting below average reviews. “Him” also looked really interesting and is completely flopping. Big Marlon Wayans fan and was really hoping this could be something special.  

Reminiscence (2021) - I love Hugh Jackman, and it felt like a 2000’s film, the sci fi world felt noir and dripping with atmosphere, at least based on the trailer, which I watched dozens of times. Came out, got bad reviews, watched it and it was the most empty forgettable experience. 

Gemini Man (2019) - Life Of Pi is one of my fave films and Will Smith was my favourite actor when I was younger. Had too much faith in Ang Lee. I didn’t hate it as much as everyone else did. But completely throwaway. 

Oz The Great & Powerful (2013) - This one hurts more in hindsight, I’ve since become a huge fan of Sam Raimi. And I really love the first 20 minutes of the film, but man does it become super generic and dull after the sepia sequence. Nightmare Alley was basically those first 20 minutes but for a whole film and I adore that film.

1nol3ot,Film with the greatest opening title/credits sequence?,20,0.68,190,1758642712.0,True,"My absolute favorites have probably got to be The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Se7en, and Spider-Man 2(2004). The best part about them is they are not merely a way to credit the cast and crew, but they actually propel the story in different ways.

The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly has a title sequence that is more or less a teaser for what’s the come in the film. The illustrations are great, the use of the airbrush to reveal the principal actors is extremely creative, and the theme song needs no introduction. One of the most iconic of all time and some of Ennio Morricone’s best work.

Se7en might be the most visually creative opening sequence of all time. The combination of the dark, disturbing imagery, the visceral editing, and the use of the song Closer by NIN is absolute perfection. They could not have set the tone any better. 

Spider-Man 2 thrives in simplicity. A quick recap of the first film with the theme song playing over it, while introducing the musical motif of the film’s villain. Again, this credit sequence has great illustrations. They are incredible to look at and it very effectively recaps the first film in a short amount of time. Another key element is the great musical score by Danny Elfman. 

Which title/credits sequence would you say is your favorite or the best?

Edit: After some thought I’d also like to add Casino Royale and The Devil’s Rejects on here as honorable mentions. Great opening credits and music from both films. ",movies

1npgezm,Movies for Loser-Round Trivia,0,0.31,3,1758730414.0,True,"I'm looking for movie recommendations for a specific trivia-based scenario. I have a wonderful trivia group that sometimes has too much fun and gets last place. Luckily our trivia host has a solid mechanic for folk like us. Our trivia is structured in six rounds with different topics, five questions for each round. The last place group gets to secretly pick the topic for next week's sixth round. Additionally, teams can elect to 'double down' a round, whereby a round has double points if you get each question within the round correct, or zero points if you get a single answer in that round wrong. Since the last place team knows their topic going into the next week, they have a better chance of successfully pulling off a double down.

We've gotten last place three times. The first time we picked 'The Artic', and we realized our mistake fairly quickly- way too broad of a topic for a week's worth of study. Then we figured out that we could just pick a movie and have a movie night with the group in-between trivia nights. So far we've done Idiocracy and Shawshank Redemption, successfully pulling off the double down each time. Now every time we're getting to the end of a trivia night, and it's looking like we're about to lose, we're scrambling for a movie pick.

Unfortunately, not every movie is perfect for this. Our team has discussed this for awhile, and here's some of the parameters we've come up with.

\- **The movie cannot be too obscure.**   
The trivia host can veto any submitted topic, and he nearly vetoed Idiocracy for being too obscure. He accepted it, but if the movie is more obscure than Idiocracy, it'll probably be rejected.

\- **The movie should not be too popular amongst hipsters aged 21-40.**   
If we pick something too popular in that demo, everyone's going to double down that round, nullifying the benefit.

\- **Standalone.**   
We only have a week to learn everything about this movie, so if there is extraneous information from sequels, an adapted book, or a stage production, we're screwed. Shawshank is based on a novella, and they asked questions about that. 

\- **Good for a Movie Night**.   
Our group is composed of single-ish guys and gals, aged 27-36. Shawshank was a smidge heavy for movie night- probably our limit. 

\- **Rewatchable.**  
I watched Idiocracy three times that week. If the movie's a little dank, that helps. 

\- **Not too scary.**  
I thought Midsommar would work for the group, and two guys said it was too scary. Bit of a shame since there's good standalone horror movies, but if someone doesn't go to movie night, the team suffers. 

  
Appreciate any movie recommendations that the group has! If we use any of these for future trivia nights, I'll totally report back with the results. ",movies

I love the 1963 film 8 1/2 by Fellini, one of his best. Parrt of what makes it special is the essence of the plot, which is btw about Marcello Mastroiannni's character (Guido), a film director, struggling with director's block. It's also the themes, the film is about reality and memory, it's about desire and fantasies. In fact, the whole thing really feels like a dream and that's where the movie begins and in a sense where it ends. As an artist, I can really relate to the struggles of the director who just cant find the inspiration but what I love way more is just the experience of the movie and of course all the beautiful scenes filled with beautiful people, including Caudia Cardinale, who is just an angel.

I grew up with Nolan's trilogy and loved it for its soundtrack and cinematography. While it was great, I wouldn't consider it an extraordinary Batman film.

Although Batman's soundtrack isn't as notable as TDK's, the cinematography, acting, and storytelling are undoubtedly better.

Batman as a whole is characterized by his dark persona and dark environment. While Nolan's attempt is close at this, its not quite perfect as it doesn't wrap around the idea of Batman being this dark, grounded vigilante in a gritty environment, which makes it somewhat more lighthearted (no offense to Dark Knight fans).

Acting: TDK's acting is good but is still flawed in the way batman interacts with some villains and in the fighting choreography. The interactions feel somewhat like a play, you know its a movie because they still look like they're acting. With the fight choreography as well, it doesn't look grounded because of how stuntmen look like they're waiting on a cue as opposed to going with the flow and moving all in one motion together. Reeve's batman successfully doesn't have all this being perfect character interactions and absolutely top of the notch fighting choreography (Just throwing this out there, the iceberg lounge fight sequence was unbelievable spectacular).

Cinematography: The batman is dark, literally and figuratively with its cinematography lacking bright and contrasting lights, which creates the overall tone of the film and its character. Nolan's cinematography is somewhat class but is discouraged with its light and semi vibrant color's in some scenes which don't fully capture the darkness of the character.

Story: The story of Reeve's batman feels more grounded because of the way it explores central themes; A city with a failing government that carries corruption (relates to real world problems from actual experiences of systematic police corruption, rigged political parties), A vigilante that is still looked down upon and aims to be a symbol of justice or vengeance (confronted with the realization of what batman truly means as a whole to the society and to himself), and a protagonist thats deemed to be imperfectly written even though it was done purposefully (a character that must confront a large problem as opposed to a singular antagonist being the city and his legacy).

While you could argue the same for the dark knight carrying these aspects, it doesn't particularly explore it as deeply as Reeves film. Nolan's film for me, feels more of like a play being ""A city saved by a white knight but is tested by chaos but is only saved by the sacrifice of its hidden savior"", where The Batman feels like a crime film more than a tragic play.

For this, I Wholeheartedly believe in the fact that The Batman is better than Dark Knight. But that's just my opinion.",movies
1npewd3,An Unsettling Trip to the Movie Theater - 28 Days Later,0,0.38,8,1758727005.0,True,"While listening to a podcast about 28 Years Later, a theater experience popped into my head that I can't believe I had forgotten.

I was living in Utah when 28 Days Later came out. I tried to see matinees whenever possible, and the showing was around 11 AM, give or take. I have Tourette Syndrome, and the small vocal tics can get a little harder to control in a theater, so I was thrilled to see that I was the only one there when the lights went down.

I sat near the front. A few minutes into the movie, I happened to look back during a flash of light on the screen and there was someone else there, near the back. I had the impression of a hoodie on a big body. He must have come in when I wasn't looking. Then I heard him cough, so it hadn't been my imagination.

For some reason, I looked back again a few minutes later. He had moved to the middle of the theater, but had switched sides. This happened a few more times. He changed seats frequently, but never came within 10 rows of me. Given the nature of the movie, this made it even harder to relax.

I don't want to make more of it than it was, so I should say that when the movie ended, I waited while he walked out. He looked completely normal. Not covered in barnacles, or blood, or slavering and cackling. ""Pretty good!"" when he saw me. He was also completely average in height and weight. So, insanely anti-climactic in hindsight, but it got me pretty wound up that day.

Has anyone here had an unsettling time at the theater, because of what was happening during the movie? ",movies

1norf1f,Cursed - 2004 - a review from 2025's perspective,1,0.52,15,1758656966.0,True,"In looking for something, anything, to take our minds off of living in 2025, my wife and I recently watched 2004's Cursed, directed by Wes Craven. This movie stars Christina Ricci, Judy Greer, Joshua Jackson and Jessie Eisenberg and its very 2004. 

If you are looking for a hard hitting, scary werewolf movie then look elsewhere because this movie would literally be scarier if the leads were being attacked by furries taking things too far. The downfall of many werewolf movies is when the wolf looks too much like a crazy stuffed animal come to life. That's happening here. 

Also, this movie is full of people that have acted before and acted since, but you'd think this was the first time anyone in this movie had ever been in front of a camera. I can't blame the actors for bad acting in a movie with a script as bad as this movie. It also feels like Wes Craven shot this as some sort of contractual obligation or in between bigger projects he wanted to do. 

I could go into the plot of this movie, but it's basically a young lady  and her nerdy brother turning into werewolves and its probably the fault of the lead's mysterious boyfriend or her romantic rival. Part of this movie takes place behind the scenes of the Craig Kilborn show (remember that?) and some of the plot concerns Scott Baio's appearance and then being cut from an episode. Also, Ricci's boyfriend played by Jackson is opening some weird goth/horror nightclub that looks doomed to failure. 

The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and the dialogue is spotty, but really the fun of this movie is that it takes place in 2004. Everyone is wearing styles from that time and it's in an America that seems young, fun and exciting. People are unironically enjoying Bowling For Soup, listening to cheesy Nu-Metal and having a good time. Nothing in this movie is that serious despite all the death and dismemberment and you can just relive 2004, a time I never, ever thought I'd be nostalgic for. 

No one in this movie has that post-pandemic look about them. We all have it now. We've all seen some shit. No one in that movie is upset about politics. Trump is still just some weird rich guy that's on TV sometimes. No mention of him or his stupid politics in the movie. Yes, this is a Bush era movie, but this movie touches on none of it because its focused on young adults/teens and that was a time where politics were generally for older people to worry about. Imagine that, politics were boring for most people. 

I do have to caution that there is homophobia from that time creeping in this movie. The trope of the homophobic high school bully in the movie turning out to be in the closet is a very 2004 subplot. Not the best aspect of this movie, but at least he stops being a bully and becomes a friend. You feel that this movie is trying to be positive, but maybe misses the mark. Then again, according to my daughter, 16 year old boys still call each other boys gay all the time and she would know as she and most her friends are LGTBQ+.

In the end, I recommend this movie if you want to teleport yourself to a different America. Like an alternate dimension. An America that doesn't exist anymore.",movies
1npbgu4,Was Graham Yost’s claim that his idea for Speed came from Runaway Train & not the nearly identical concept of Bullet Train to avoid getting sued or make him look original?,0,0.16,3,1758718762.0,True,"*Screenwriter Graham Yost was told by his father, Canadian television host Elwy Yost, about a 1985 film called Runaway Train starring Jon Voight, about a train that speeds out of control. Elwy mistakenly believed that the train's situation was due to a bomb on board. Such a theme had in fact been used in The Bullet Train. After seeing the Voight film, Graham decided that it would have been better if there had been a bomb on board a bus with the bus being forced to travel at 20 mph to prevent an actual explosion. A friend suggested that this be increased to 50 mph.*

This may be poorly paraphrased, misquoted or out of context but to me it sounds like nonsense if its  accurate. There is absolutely nothing even remotely similar in that description to the concept for Speed, whose premise is practically identical to Bullet Train.

1no02zp,"September 19-21 Box Office Recap – Despite collapsing 75%, 'Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle' becomes the biggest anime title domestically ($104.7M) and worldwide ($555M). 'Him' opens with a so-so $13.2M, while 'A Big Bold Beautiful Journey' flops with an anemic $3.2M against a $45M budget.",79,0.85,12,1758578776.0,True,"https://preview.redd.it/dbvnezwhhsqf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e187c4c2b3049194e61f1651b604a24ba8a5a16

With two newcomers failing to meet expectations, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** held the top spot despite its steep second weekend drop. ***Him*** had a so-so debut, but its opening was quite front-loaded, suggesting the future is not bright for the film. But the real loser this weekend was Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey***, which had one of the worst debuts for any film playing at 3,000 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $60.1 million this weekend, which was down 19.5% from last year, when ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** repeated at #1 for a third weekend and ***Transformers One*** flopped.

Keeping the top spot, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** earned $17.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 75% drop, although drops like these are common in anime films, especially fan-driven ones. Still, it's a steeper drop than ***Mugen Train*** (69.5%).

But with $104.7 million domestically, ***Infinity Castle*** has officially become the biggest anime title in the country, finally dethroning ***Pokémon: The First Movie*** ($85.7 million), although ***Pokémon*** is still ahead of it in terms of inflation ($166.7 million). As it loses IMAX and other PLF screens this week, it will continue dropping hard.

In second place, Universal's ***Him*** debuted with $13.2 million in 3,168 theaters. This debut is below other football-themed films, but it's hard to find comparisons given that this is a sports horror film, which is very rare to find. 

The film cost $27 million, so a $13.2 million debut isn't bad. The problem, however, is how front-loaded it was: Friday ($6.4 million) represented a massive 49% of the weekend's gross, while Saturday and Sunday saw steep drops, falling to third place. That's why this debut is just so-so.

There's no doubt that Universal bet high on this, but primarily because of producer Jordan Peele's involvement. His name was plastered all over the posters and trailers, leading many to believe this was his new directorial effort. While that's misleading, you usually use your biggest asset as the selling point. And it worked; with the exception of Marlon Wayans (who isn't really a box office draw), the cast and crew are not familiar to the public. If Universal ditched Peele's name from the marketing, perhaps the film would miss $10 million.

When marketing began, they sold a very efficient premise: *Whiplash* meets football meets horror. That's a very interesting concept, especially when sport horror films are incredibly rare in theaters. As the film got closer to release, however, Universal leaned more into supernatural elements while highlighting even further Peele's involvement. That felt a bit desperate, but again, you use your best asset. Although in this case, the reviews did not help: it's sitting at a very poor 29% on RT. Considering Peele's producing credits are often well-received, that was a huge red flag.

According to Universal, 51% of the audience was male, and 64% was 25 and over. Critics slammed the film, and unfortunately, the audience agreed: they gave it a horrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, even for horror that's bad. With poor word of mouth and a front-loaded debut, it's clear the film is gonna fall off a cliff very quickly. There's a very strong chance it will finish below $30 million domestically. And that spells flop territory, as football isn't popular outside America (check the overseas section for this film).

After its horrible second weekend drop, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** had another rough drop, thanks to ***Him***. This time, it fell 52%, earning $12.2 million this weekend. The film has amassed $150.5 million, officially becoming the biggest film in the franchise. If it continues dropping like this, it might miss $180 million.

***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** added $6.4 million this weekend. That's a brutal 65% drop, far worse than any of the prior films. Through 10 days, the film has earned $31.7 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $50 million domestically.

Despite some horror competition, ***The Long Walk*** held very well on its second weekend. It dipped 47%, adding $6.2 million. Pretty good, considering 50% or more is usually the norm. Through 10 days, the film has made $22.6 million, and it should finish with around $35 million if it keeps holding well.

Debuting in sixth place, Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** flopped with an anemic $3.2 million in 3,330 theaters. That's the sixth worst debut for any film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Incredibly depressing fact: Margot Robbie's other film, ***Babylon***, is also the eighth worst debut ($3.6 million in 3,343 theaters). Which means she has starred in the two worst debuts at 3,300 theaters. It's also the second worst wide debut for Colin Farrell, only ahead of ***Voyagers*** ($1.3 million).

This debut also translates to a pathetic $977 per-theater average. If each theater was playing this film in 5 screenings at an average $11.31 ticket price, that means that there were just 5 people at each screening. Sony bought the film for $50 million, setting it as a $45 million production. Yet the film couldn't open to 10% of that figure. That's one of the worst ROI debuts for a wide release. How could it fare this badly? 

Romance films are definitely profitable. But mixing romance with fantasy is a niche market; some people don't like that combination. And the concept (doors taking the characters on a journey to the past) just didn't connect with audiences. Fantasy dramas are just difficult to pull off, especially at the box office.

Sony had the film set for May, but they decided to move it to this weekend, hoping to capitalize on weak competition. But the film simply lacked buzz compared to other titles this month. And while Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell are recognizable names, they're not exactly huge draws: Robbie has starred in a lot of flops prior to ***Barbie***, and Farrell has been part of many panned flops for the past 20 years. So their presence doesn't guarantee success (then again, who does?). But the real nail in the coffin was the reviews. Adult dramas need acclaim just to stand a chance, but the film's poor 37% on RT dissuaded those interested from checking out.

According to Sony, 59% of the audience was female, and 76% was 25 and over. They gave it a poor ""B–"" on CinemaScore, quite rough for a romance title. With such a poor debut, zero buzz and incoming competition, the film will not last long in theaters. It would be a surprise if the film made it past $10 million domestically. That's absolutely horrible.

In seventh place, Angel Studios' ***The Senior*** earned just $2.6 million in 2,405 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in those theaters. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, it will disappear quickly from theaters.

The 30th anniversary re-release of ***Toy Story*** dropped 59%, earning $1.4 million. That takes its lifetime gross to $198.4 million.

In ninth place, Fathom Events' re-release of ***Howl's Moving Castle*** earned $1.4 million this weekend. That takes its lifetime total to $10.5 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was Fathom Events' ***Sight & Sound Presents: NOAH Live!***, which made $1.3 million from 933 theaters.

Outside the Top 10, ***Weapons*** dropped 54% and added $1.2 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $149.7 million.

***Freakier Friday*** dropped 46% for a $1.1 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $92.9 million, and it's now certain to miss $100 million domestically.

MUBI expanded ***The History of Sound*** to 552 theaters, but it could only muster $309,072. It's unlikely it can perform much better than this.

#**OVERSEAS**

It is official: with $555 million worldwide, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** has become the biggest anime title in history, dethroning ***Mugen Train***. It came from $36 million overseas this weekend, with big debuts in France ($8.6M) and Germany ($8.2M). The biggest markets are Japan ($269M), South Korea ($37.3M), Taiwan ($25M), Mexico ($15.1M), Hong Kong ($12.4M), India ($8.1M), the UK ($7.5M), and Indonesia ($7.3M). By next week, it should cross $600 million.

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $28.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $399.3 million (so damn close man). The best markets are Mexico ($26.4M), the UK ($20.3M), Brazil ($15.3M), France ($14.6M) and Germany ($12.7M). While it won't hit $500 million, it should still safely hit $450 million worldwide.

***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** added $8.3 million overseas, for a $59.4 million worldwide total. Its best markets are the UK ($13.9M), France ($2.6M), Australia ($2.4M), Netherlands ($1.9M) and Finland ($1.2M). It still has some markets left.

***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey*** also had horrible news in the rest of the world. It debuted with just $4.5 million overseas, for a very poor $7.7 million worldwide total. Even though that's just 42 markets, that's still an underwhelming debut and doesn't point to a bright future.

***Him*** debuted in 25 markets, but it could only earn an abysmal $258K, for a very underwhelming $13.5 million worldwide debut. The result is not surprising; football is not popular outside America, so films focused on that lean heavily on the domestic side. The only markets where it has a chance to perform solidly are Mexico, the UK and Brazil (markets where the NFL is popular), all of which open in October. But don't expect any of them to save the film.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*The Naked Gun* | Aug/1 | Paramount | $16,805,560 | $52,647,396 | $101,847,396 | $42M
*Nobody 2* | Aug/15 | Universal | $9,251,190 | $21,604,985 | $39,299,926 | $25M

- Paramount's ***The Naked Gun*** has closed with $52 million domestically and $101 million worldwide. Not exactly a smash hit, but not a bad amount. Especially considering how comedies are struggling in theaters, and how people were hesitant over having someone replace Leslie Nielsen here. But with such good reception, there's clearly some interest here. If it makes a killing on home media, it should spawn sequels.

- Nobody was interested in ***Nobody 2***, which closed with just $21 million domestically and $39 million worldwide. Somehow, it managed to earn less than the original, which opened in far worse conditions. Perhaps it's a sign that there's not much interest in this franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

Three newcomers arrive in wide release.

The big release is WB's ***One Battle After Another***, the newest film from Paul Thomas Anderson. Headlined by Leonardo DiCaprio, it follows a group of ex-revolutionaries who reunite to rescue the daughter of one of their own after an enemy resurfaces. The film has enjoyed incredible reviews (97% on RT, 96 on Metacritic) and WB even secured IMAX screenings for the film. WB is certainly enjoying an incredible streak at the box office. But with the exception of ***Boogie Nights*** and ***There Will Be Blood***, PTA's films are known for flopping at the box office. On its advantage, this is his first film playing at more than 3,000 theaters and securing PLF screenings. But it's still carrying a high $130 million budget, which means it's gonna need over $300 million worldwide just to break even. Pressure is very high on this one. If the opening weekend begins with a ""2"", that's definitely gonna be a very disappointing figure. It'll need to make a big first impression.

DreamWorks is also releasing ***Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie***, a continuation of the Netflix series. There aren't many options for kids right now, given that ***The Bad Guys 2*** is almost 2 months old and on its way out of theaters. Perhaps it can surprise.

And Lionsgate is also releasing ***The Strangers – Chapter 2***, almost one year and a half after ***Chapter 1*** hit theaters. Despite its poor reception, it still made $48 million. But with such a gap and very little good will for this ""trilogy"", it's very unlikely it can reach those numbers.

1np6lzy,2025 The Ritual - I Actually Preferred The Exorcism of Anna Ecklund A Bit More,0,0.35,0,1758701969.0,True,"Yes you had Al Pacino as the lead priest but for the past few decades it always seemed like it is Al Pacino playing as Al Pacino. He was such a good actor in the 70s and early 80s but since I never felt like he was playing a character just playing himself. 

I also felt the movie Exorcism of Anna Ecklund humanized Emma more. Anna Ecklund and Emma Schmidt are the same person. In Anna Ecklund we saw her husband and an interview with a friend of hers both added to her as a person. Here I felt she was not much more then a patient needed an exorcism. Also when Pacino said Emma was sensitive I felt that part was much better handled in the other movie with the friend who gave concrete examples. 

Was Father Joe and Sister Rose lovers? I got the impression they could have been from the start of movie. I do wish we knew what happened to her after the exorcism. The Mother Superior was far more strong willed in Anna Ecklund I can’t picture her letting Sister Rose run off into the catacombs while staying huddled in her office. 

I am also not sure why a convent would have catacombs. Googling Wisconsin, convents and catacombs I found nothing. I am not sure why the movie would include something in a “biopic” that is easily disprovable. 

I really had a more enjoyable time last night watching Demon Witch Child from 1975 it was at least fun and an interesting take of a possessed girl who seemed more willing to be possessed then a victim. 

Al Pacino’s pep talks were getting on my nerves. He sounded more like a football coach than priest. ",movies

Bjork had a really bad experience making the movie because she didn't get along with Lars Von Trier, so much so she quit acting. She only did two movies afterwards and even those were small parts. Pity, because Bjork could act jer ass off. 

Von Trier wanted Selma to behave like a moron, just like Bess, and Bjork refused to do that, she wanted to make Selma smarter and more independent. 

The ending felt pretty contrived to me. The nice neighbor turns psycho and begs Selma to kill him. And after she accidentally shoos him, she starts running and singing and then decides she'll plea guilty and be hanged so her son can keep the money for his surgery to save his eyesight. Does that seem like a logical ending? 

Either way, I loved it. It didn't make me angry like in Breaking the Waves where Jan is a pig who is responsible for Bess's death and we're supposed to be happy about how her sacrifice saved Jan. He forced her to degrade herself for sex. 

Dancer in the Dark gives Selma ownership on her fate and it felt more dignified with the song and Siobhann Fallon as a support system. That's just me!",movies

* ""And when everyone's super... **no one will be.**"" *This quote is said by Syndrome, the main villian of the film, once he captures the entire family. He planed to make everyone a superhero in his city, but in doing so everyone would become equal, therefore it would be as if the city never had powers to begin with.*
* ""See? Now you respect me because **I am a threat.**"" *Also said by Syndrome, when he successfully thrashes Mr Incredible with his machine and introduces himself earlier into the movie. Mr Incredible apologises for his harsh attitude to Syndrome when he was a young ""fan"" (Incrediboy) but Syndrome's arrogance makes him feel more powerful than he really is, ignoring his apology and heightening his ego.*
* ""Coincidence? **I think NOT!**"" *This is said by Dash's teacher, Bernie, who goes on an entire tangent accusing Dash of placing pins in his chair, towards his headteacher, but since Dash is too fast, the camera is unable to catch the exact frame of Dash leaving to place the pins in his chair.

It’s not true, and 2. All of the people who say this, don’t watch original new films. Many moronic movie YouTubers like critical drinker and Nerdrotic, constantly say they only make superheroes and remakes and no original films are made. However many are, A24 is an entire industry dedicated solely to making nothing but original unique films. Many directors such as Paul Thomas Anderson are constantly making great original films.

But the people that run these channels, who say this, ONLY make content dedicated to superhero and remake films. They complain about them, but that’s all that they review. Do they go see original films, no. Do they review them, no. Do they give any attention to them, no. If people want more original films, then they should see them and make them the highest grossing films of the year, more original films will be made that way. 

I’m sick of people who complain about no originality, then let so many great original films completely bomb at the box office, and then fly off the radar and be completely forgotten. Eddington was a great film that completely flew under the radar and bombed. PTA’s new film One Battle After Another is a film by a very talented director with a huge budget and stacked cast, do these channels talk about it? Nope, not a word. It’s gonna completely bomb and barely be discussed. People who don’t see original films, shouldn’t complain that there are no original films, because they are completely contributing to this misconception that “there is no originality” by not giving original films any attention and constantly reviewing the regurgitated slop that they claim to hate so much.",movies

* Ranked 147 out of 1,591
* 7/10 on IMBD
* 4 out of 5 on Letterboxd

It is very rare, in my opinion, where a sequel is better than the original. I believe this is one of those rare occasions. 

The sequel to Final Destination, properly titled Final Destination 2, is done much better than the original. The death scenes are better, the tie backs to the original are great, I think the characters are better too. It might be due to how I can relate to the older cast in the sequel vs. the younger cast in the original. But it's just done better overall. There is a down side to not really having a satisfying update on one of the main characters in the original (trying not to give spoilers). But overall this is the movie in the series that people think about. The highway death scene....that is some people's worst nightmare come to life.

As a whole, I would highly recommend the whole Final Destination franchise of movies. They do start to go a bit downhill after the 2nd one, but they are always a wild ride to watch with suspense and blood. What more could you ask for?!  But this is a classic in my opinion. This movie was made in 2002 and it still gives people nightmares about a certain scenario. I know without the original, the sequel doesn't exist, however, it's better in every single metric in my opinion. Faster paced, keeps your attention a bit more than the original. The list goes on. You are missing out if you haven't watched this at least once in your life.

One of them is security camera angles. 
When reviewing security footage, sometimes the images are just the scene itself (that we already saw), in the exact same angle, with some added grain and tint. Security cameras aren't placed 5 feet high facing the person head on, they are in the corner of the room 9-feet hig at least. I know it is cheaper to reuse footage, but it also cheapens the experience of watching it. 

Another is people sleeping that don't wake up when someone enters the room, sits beside them, tucks a loose strand of hair behind the ear and give them a kiss on the forehead. 
They can't be that heavy sleepers, unless they drained an entire bottle of wine or vodka beforehand. 
I wake up as soon as someone enters the room, let alone kiss me on the forehead. I would instinctively punch them in the face from the scare alone. 

CPR. Come on, people, it is not so difficult to at least learn the correct position to do it. 
Punching the chest won't work, and neither will just pushing with your hands, without any weight behind it. 
They don't have to get the timing right, nor have to call emergency services on their phone while doing compressions. Just get the position correct, it literally takes only 30 seconds to learn it (and who knows, maybe they can actually save somebody for real, sometime).

1noofp8,A Nolan-esque Pirates of the Caribbean Film (Totally Serious),0,0.26,26,1758650210.0,True,"
Everyone talks about rebooting Pirates, but I think the original trilogy's world is too rich to abandon. The problem with the later films was a tonal shift. So, what if we went the other way? What if we made a sequel that was a serious, philosophical epilogue to the Age of Piracy, steeped in the themes of Christopher Nolan but also keeping the sense of adventure and humor we see in Inception?

I'm calling this pitch:

Pirates of the Caribbean: THE DUTCHMAN'S GAMBIT

THE LOGLINE: Two decades after the War on Piracy, a disillusioned Captain Jack Sparrow, now hiding in the Royal Navy, is tasked with using experimental technology to erase the mythic Flying Dutchman from history—a mission that forces him to confront the ghost of his past and choose between a safe future or a chance to rewrite his own legacy.

THE SETUP:

· A Changed World: The Age of Piracy is a fading memory. The British Empire, under the cold, calculating Admiral Shaw (Guy Pearce), has nearly stamped out magic and myth in the name of Order and Progress.

· A Hidden Sparrow: Jack is older, weary, and living under the alias ""John Griffin."" (John G.) He's a surprisingly competent Navy Captain, his flamboyance replaced by a cynical restraint. It's the perfect hiding place: who would look for Jack Sparrow in the heart of the institution he despised? Yet, he's haunted by the spectral, taunting form of Hector Barbossa, a manifestation of his guilt over their countless betrayals in the quest for immortality (the Fountain of Youth, the Pearl, etc.).

· The Empire's Weapon: Admiral Shaw introduces Jack to Dr. Alistair Finch (Cillian Murphy), a brilliant scientist who represents the new age. Finch hasn't built a bigger cannon; he's discovered a ""Temporal Current""—a way to sail not across oceans, but through time itself. The Empire's goal isn't just to sink the Dutchman; it's to retroactively erase its existence from history, making a symbolic end to all pirate legends.

THE CONFLICT:

Shaw's plan is simple: Lure the Dutchman by targeting its heart. They will apprehend Elizabeth Swann and her son (who has a rebellious, piratical streak), knowing Will Turner will come for them.

But this mission forces a profound internal struggle in Jack:

1. The Ghost of Barbossa: Barbossa's ghost isn't just for scares. He is Jack's id, his pirate conscience. He constantly mocks Jack's ""cowardice,"" reminding him of their shared history of chasing immortality. ""All that effort for the Fountain,"" Barbossa would sneer, ""and now the Crown hands ye the key to eternity itself. Will ye die a servant to the king, Jack? Or finally seize yer destiny?""

2. The Moral Abyss: Jack is torn. Part of him wants to save Will and Elizabeth, the last remnants of a code he once understood. But a darker, more desperate part sees the Temporal Current as his last, best chance at the immortality he always sought. He begins to fantasize about not just finding the Dutchman, but usurping it. He could become the new Captain, a timeless legend, rewriting his story not as a failed pirate, but as the eternal master of the seas.

3. The Wrath of the Old Gods: The Empire's plan to undo history does not go unnoticed. Tia Dalma/Calypso re-emerges. As the goddess of the sea, the Empire's temporal meddling is an affront to the natural, chaotic order she embodies. She doesn't side with pirates or empires; she seeks to destroy the technology that threatens to unravel the very fabric of her domain. She confronts Jack, not as an ally, but as a force of nature, forcing him to see that his choice has consequences far greater than his personal desires.

THE NOLAN TOUCH:

· Non-Linear Storytelling: The film would weave between the present mission and fragmented, vivid flashbacks of Jack and Barbossa's legendary (and backstabbing) partnerships, showing the roots of Jack's obsession with cheating death.

· Practical Effects & Scale: The Dutchman wouldn't be just a CGI ghost ship. It would be a terrifying, tangible leviathan emerging from unnatural storms. The ""Temporal Current"" would be a visceral, dangerous phenomenon, like sailing into a tidal wave of shattered memories.

· Thematic Depth: This isn't about a treasure chest. It's about legacy, time, and the cost of progress. Is it better for a beautiful, wild legend to die, or for it to be systematically erased as if it never was?

THE CLIMAX:

The final act is a three-way battle in a temporal maelstrom: The Empire's fleet, the monstrous Dutchman, and Calypso's raging seas. Jack, facing Will Turner one last time, is given the ultimate choice: activate the Temporal Current to erase the Dutchman (and his own past), seize the ship for himself, or sabotage the machine.

His final decision wouldn't be for treasure, but for meaning.

1nmsoq3,"I rewatched Amélie after 20 years. It’s still one of my very favorite films, which surprised me when I realized how “tell don’t show” it is.",1138,0.93,118,1758463113.0,True,"Amélie has got to be one of the most accessible foreign films out there to an English speaking audience. I was around 13 when it released, and my experience watching it wasn’t all that different seeing it again at 37. People even show it to young children and they get it, too (despite puritanical ratings boards getting their knickers in a twist about the comedic and rather brief sex scenes).

What really leapt out at me this time was something that I guess can only come with 20+ years of film literacy since my first watch: that the film takes *every* opportunity it can to be as crystal clear as possible about what is going on, to the point that it becomes “tell not show” at a baseline level. Or at least, “tell AND show.”

Jean-Pierre Jeunet has his actors speak from the heart (while they emote so bombastically and delightfully you could understand their mental state from watching this on a vaseline-smeared TV set), and any time Amélie has a big moment of change, a narrator is there to guide us through an exact breakdown of her thoughts and beliefs. Many important characters get an entire origin story told to us and a quick bullet point list read off about how they think. There are amazing visuals and stagings and editing and all of it is very clever language of its own, but it is all so on the nose and makes for what’s probably the least challenging “great movie” I’ve ever seen. And I love that it succeeds so thoroughly in spite of that… or perhaps, more interestingly, because of it.

Part of me has been almost conditioned by challenging cinema and video essays that demand a viewer pay close attention and do a lot of mental work to fully enjoy cinema, and there sometimes seems to be this belief going around in film circles that anything that doesn’t require deep thought is somehow a lesser form of art… but here is Amélie, cheerfully and lovingly doing the opposite, bringing viewers to happy tears whether they’re analyzing it or not. And I love it for it. Especially now. I needed that escape yesterday.

And I want to remind others that yes, there is a ticket to happiness that you can have too, and it exists in the form of a doe-eyed lead on a quirky green DVD box (or I guess, stream it too) and it doesn’t require you to be at your most tip-top shape as a viewer to just deeply connect to it on a soul level.

Magnifique.

———

*Edit: some have pointed out that Amélie is very tell **AND** show and I have to agree with that. Telling without showing would actually mean having things like empty backstory and inauthentic dialogue that gives unnecessary and unbelievable exposition dumps, and conveying information in a way that actively makes the emotional viewing experience worse. So the film deftly sidesteps all those common pitfalls in its rulebreaking.*",movies

Pacino truly gave a masterclass in ‘How to Act’ in this film. Cazale… he told so much from just his eyes. And in an unintentional moment of heartbreak for me, his line about not smoking due to not wanting to ‘get the cancer’ hit me really got in the gut. If it wasn’t for his cancer, we absolutely would have seen him continue to star in great films and be on ‘Best of’ lists.

The first time I watched this, I was so captivated by JK's intensity that I wasn't fully able to appreciate the actual musicianship and audio of the scene.

I say this as someone who had a decent amount of music training (piano and orchestra as a kid)- it's possible someone with less training will have a harder time hearing it, but conversely to someone better trained than me it'd probably be *glaringly* obvious to the point of sounding genuinely bad or distracting.

I was just wondering if anyone else had the same experience, or if maybe any of y'all caught the tempo being off upon first watch, or if maybe you haven't caught it before, you now want to go try!

When you think of Shawshank, do you see it more as a story of personal survival and hope, or more as a statement about the system and society?

1nogvxc,Is a Great Movie with a terrible ending still a great movie?,0,0.26,39,1758632780.0,True,"Simple question. If there's a movie that is really good for most of the runtime, but then the ending sucks, can it still be considered a great movie?

For example, I don't think everyone is going to agree with me, but today I saw Watchmen (2009) for the first time which led me to this dilemma. I really like the movie. The characters are amazing imo (except Laurie and Dan). The story is also great. I was prepared to give it a really high score. But then, the ending happened. (SPOILERS) >!Don't get me wrong, I like Ozymandias and his plan, the problem for me is how the movie sides with the villain, attempting to justify his actions. Ozymandias is wrong. The cycle will eventually repeat itself, and when it does, there won't be an Ozy to unite the world temporarily. Peace won't last. Plus we should forge our own destiny and future. We don't need some individual making decisions on what our future should be. If we are doomed to nuclear warfare then so be it. What if the war were somehow resolved peacefully and didn't happen at all? What about that small possibility, like, idk, real life maybe??? Neither event happened IRL. Ozymandias robs us of that possibility. !<  
  
>!I don't have a problem with any of this, because Ozy is the villain, it's ok for him to be wrong. But then the script dumbs down Dr Manhattan and he agrees with Ozy, ruining the best character in the movie, not to mention he also kills the second best character in a super anticlimactic way (Rorschach)??? What happened to all that talk about miracles?? Why didn't that pay off in the ending?? Hell, if it must end like this, at least have SOMEONE brutalize Ozymandias just to get a bit of satisfaction out of it. The only MCs that survive and aren't ruined were the most boring ones (Laurie and Dan). !<  
  
TLDR, I really like Watchmen but I hate the ending with a passion, and now I have a dilemma of whether to consider the movie great or not. What do you think? Do note that they are technically 2 separate questions. One is whether a bad ending can ruin a great movie. The other (which you don't have to answer if you dont want to) is whether the ending of Watchmen 2009 in particular ruins Watchmen 2009.  
  
Also, if you want to discuss Watchmen in particular, keep it focused on the 2009 movie. I haven't read the comic, and I'm not really interested in doing so. Pretend the 2009 movie is a standalone original film or something idk, I don't really care about comic accuracy.",movies

Now here I am, confused about the hype and popularity, looking for answers. I get that tension and suspense play a big role in this movie, though I’ve seen it done better. I also get that the film leans heavily on its big-name actors—Pacino and De Niro both give strong performances. But is that all there is? Am I missing something?

The action sequences fall flat for me, and the big shootout feels dumb and unnecessarily long. I can see how the movie tries to stay grounded and realistic, but then it undermines itself with scenes where dozens of cops somehow keep missing three guys standing in the open. So I don’t really get it, the action isn’t engaging just so it can hold up as realism, and the plot keeps contradicting that realism anyway.

I was thinking about what if it was remade today. It has some potential with a little rework. 

What I'm thinking:   
The story is more about how books can help kids in the real world. Either as comfort, inspiration, or relatability to something they are going through. The main character is a kid who is struggling with stuff in his life. (family divorcing? school struggles? bullies? being true to themselves? ect) 

One day, he goes to the library and gets transported to the ""illustration"" world like in the original.  He of course meet the personification of Adventure, Horror, and Fantasy. Perhaps each sharing resemblance with someone in his life? (coach, teacher, neighbor, ect) They go through each genre world where the kid learns and grow from each visit. Taking risks in adventure, creativity from fantasy, and bravery from horror. Or something along those lines. 

I am curious what actors would fit this story. Any thoughts? 

I thought maybe Fantasy is play by an actress who give that motherly caring vibe but has that spunk to her.   
Horror someone intimidating but speaks gently?   
Adventure defiantly should be played by someone with a lot of energy and daring behavior.

(For reference, a bad movie here doesn't have to be one that lost money, just one you thought was otherwise terrible.) 


* I think The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies was pretty forgettable but **Martin Freeman** is very, very good casting as Bilbo. Actually, most of the casting is perfectly fine in the Hobbit movies, the issues are more with the writing and the CGI. Bilbo is the real standout though.


* **Raul Julia** in Street Fighter is a famous one. Famously he took the role for his kids, and you can really see that he takes it as seriously as any other prestigious acting job.


* Twilight did huge at the box office but it has a pretty bad reputation with audiences. That said, I've never heard one bad word about **Billy Burke** as Charlie Swan. He actually does an extremely good job in all 5 movies, and despite not being a main character (and having less to work with), he really elevates that character above many of the other characters with more screen time.


* Also from the Twilight franchise, I would nominate **Michael Sheen** as Aro. His performance is *insane* but he makes the character so much fun every time he's on screen. The leader of an evil group of vampires could be a very dry role - they usually don't do anything, they have maybe 20 collective minutes of screen time in the whole franchise until the final battle, but he gave one of the most memorable performances in the entire saga.

However I am now a senior and looking at the movie again I can’t say I’m comfortable with the age gap at all. The age gap wouldn’t be a problem if they were in their early 20’s but the issue is that these kids are STILL high schoolers. I’m looking at the freshman that go to my school today and I’m looking back at my own freshman year and I’m able to identify the maturity gap in my own thinking.

It just feels weird, Charlie is quite literally showing up to parties with mass amounts of drugs and alcohol and is in one way or another being peer pressured into drinking. He’s had copious amounts of weed, and all of this is being supplied by his freinds who I would assume are over the age of 18. And by the way, some of these kids are considered the smart kids of their grade, Mary Anne literally goes to HARVARD but then at the same time is trying to diddle with a freshman after prom. bro ew??? I’m in a lot of ways dumber than the people in that friend group but brother never would I EVER supply a freshman or even a sophomore with things they shouldn’t be messing with, (I don’t have access to that lol but even if I did it would be a no). On top of that, and I don’t mean to victim blame but like bro as a freshman I think I would’ve been smart enough not to indulge in that stuff. And I know people are going to say like “oh he lost his best friend” yes but like I don’t think drugs are the answer.

I personally had a close friend die to suicide (I’m good tho) in my junior year and I was really messed up for a long time but I don’t think I would ever drink or even take a form of drugs, and maybe it’s because I was a junior but man I had very easy access to those things in that moment yet I chose to stay away. I know that everyone grieves differently but his friends KNEW that and still let him mess with substances? That’s like really bad and really wrong in my opinion.

I don’t know it’s just the age dynamics, the physical part of it being like “oh so we are okay with kissing 14 year olds as 18 year olds, awesome!” It just makes me a bit uneasy at times. ",movies

against all odds, coppola has not let the critical or commercial failure of megalopolis disway him from making more movies. in fact, he's confirmed that he's already starting development on his next movie, a musical adaptation of the 1922 novel glimpses of the moon. however, to be quite frank, i don't see it happening anytime soon.

coppola completely self financed megalopolis, even selling a portion of his incredibly profitable wine company in order to completely self finance the movie. however, the film's commercial failure means that coppola has no way to do the same with glimpses of the moon. and after megalopolis did so poorly with both critics and average moviegoers, it's highly unlikely that anyone is gonna want to touch anything coppola is involved in with a 10 foot pole. sure, coppola is the man behind the first two godfather movies and apocalypse now but that will only get you so far.

The seats are comfier than ever, the televisions and sound systems would make our ancestors faint, and thanks to streaming services, we have a huge selection of films to choose from.

Yet the movie theater experience lives on.

While box offices haven’t returned to their pre-pandemic numbers, recent trends like [GentleMinions](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/style/minions-gentleminions-tik-tok-trend.html) and [Chicken Jockey](https://www.thepopverse.com/movies-a-minecraft-movie-chicken-jockey-meme-xplained-jack-black-jason-momoa) have created cultural moments centered around the theater experience.

If you need proof, try shouting “chicken jockey” alone in your living room. It doesn’t pack the same punch as it does when you’re doing it along with an excited audience.

According to Warner Bros., these communal moments are the reason why the theater experience is so important. It’s not only fun, but it connects us with strangers during times when we might feel isolated.

  
“I think that Hollywood, and just cinema in general, and foreign films as well, are empathy machines.” “Warner Bros. co-chair Mike De Luca says. “When you sit in a theater with 300 to 500 people that you don't know, who all laugh at the same joke, or jump at the same scare, or cry at the same scene, it's an empathy machine, and you feel something in that collective human experience of letting a storyteller tell you a story passively.”

1nmsei3,American Sweatshop - Narrative mystery thriller,7,0.63,28,1758462404.0,True,"I've just seen the movie and it was a very interesting watch for a quiet cloudy Sunday movie. The protagonist is a content moderator whom does her job with relative qualms and acceptance of being forced to see terrible things so many others don't need to, until a video truly shocks her. Unable to stop thinking about it, she decides she has to do something with it. 

This premise makes it appear as a revenge movie of sort, but it's a much more tranquil and people-oriented movie: the characters in it have their own approaches and ideas about the job, and slowly open up to each other, while the protagonist slowly seems to spiral into obsession. I remember reading an article on such jobs moderating content for Youtube and Google, and how it affected the people that ended up needing to watch such content for hours on end, unable to stop dreaming about them.

It wasn't a perfect movie by all means (I really hope companies that do this have way better rules and treatments for their employees and dealing with cases that appear to be related to murder), but it was a very interesting watch to immerse myself into, and even if I saw the ending coming from miles away, it gives enough understanding of how things are going to play out once the movie ends. The film premiered at the 2025 South by Southwest Film & TV Festival in March as part of the Narrative Spotlight category, so I'll look forward to watch other movies on the list. Lili Reinhart reminds me a bit of Maika Monroe, so I'll be sure to keep track of the movies she chooses to participate into.

The scene is so technically inaccurate that my wife who has no mechanical aptitude even questioned it. 

They make a hoist using the bus with the broken axle. My wife said 'how is the axle turning if is broken? 

One of the characters somehow removes and replaces the bus tire so the wheel can be used for the hoist. That would be very hard to do. 

They build a boom out of 'pieces of guard rail' but the boom looks nothing like the steel from the guard rail and they seem to have another rim to use as a pulley from out of nowhere 

They unbolt the entire axle housing from the junk bus. That is not how you replace broken axles on commercial truck axles. You unbolt the center hub and slide the axle out. It would be a nightmare disconnecting the brake lines and driveshaft. Plus, why did the junk bus not have wheels on the side facing down?

The axle housing assemble would weigh probably 1500 lbs, and they somehow drag it up a cliff and remove the original 1500lb housing and replace with the scavenged 1500lb housing. 

Somehow they have hydraulic jacks to lift the bus and every tool required to complete the repair and build the hoist. 

This job would take days for an experienced mechanic in a shop designed to work on busses. The timeline is suggesting they complete the job in couple hours.

They also manage to pull the bus upright from laying on it's side with equipment that I guess was hidden on the bus? 

I spot impossible mechanical things in movies all the time and let it slide, but this scene is absurd.

1nni08h,Is HIM actually good?,0,0.19,4,1758534001.0,True,"After sleeping on it, HIM is actually way better and more effective than I thought. There are quite a few disturbing scenes that stuck out to me, but the one that unnerves me the most is the part where>!Cameron performs helmet to helmet tackle that leaves the quarterback convulsing and coughing up blood on the ground!<; the scene is so visceral, I actually had a nightmare about it. 

The film is making a broader point about the disturbing nature of contact sports in general, like football and boxing; we should feel disturbed by it, but we aren't because it's framed as pure spectacle. We often cheer at the disturbing nature of sports even at their most brutal, like people craving a brutal knockout while watching boxing. The film exaggerates the brutality of, in this case, football as a hypocritical mirror in that we (as a society) claim to abhor violence yet we love the spectacle of violence. Without the commentary, the commercials, the onscreen graphics, the music, the crowd of Monday Night Football, we're left with the naked savagery of football (or contact sports in general) and it is quite unsettling.

Regarding Marlon Wayans as Isaiah White, I thought it was bad acting, but I've since realized that the character himself is acting out the part he's expected to play by the power structures he exists within: the owners, the team, the fans, the public at large. He's manipulative, performative, stiff, sociopathic, jealous, and lustful. The off-putting performance actually forces the viewer into the position of critic in a similar way to how the average person watches sports critically by judging every little move of the professional, as in ""you better meet my standards and expectations"". The film accomplishes this without the person being aware just like people aren't aware when watching sports in real life. 

Marlon Wayans' performance also mirrors the sociopathic expectation that sports fans place on those they deem as superstars. They don't admit that outright, but the expectation is that superstars act as obsessive, violent, unfeeling killers (not in the literal sense but in that they crush anyone in their way without empathy or mercy; people literally call it the killer instinct) who are able to push through any and all pain. Sports fans become sociopathic through their dehumanization of the hero, the superstar, and pass that sociopathy on to them through their expectations which is then mirrored back to them as an ideal, a goal, a purpose. 

The film is uncomfortable throughout symbolizing that heavy contact sports should unnerve and disturb rather than entertain. But, most people consume sports as pure spectacle; they're watching people destroy their own bodies for other people's entertainment, and as soon as they're completely broken, they're discarded and fall into obscurity. 

You can feel that tension throughout the film, that Cameron Cade is one misstep away from being broken and seemingly losing everything: the fame, the glory, the status, the power; the things that everyone craves in this society yet obfuscate through flowery language. The film is actually good  because it holds up a mirror to both sports and movie fans in which they become one and the same (the questions being: Are you actually entertained by this? and Is this even supposed to be entertaining?), and unmasks the spectacle for what it is, a disturbing mess.

1966: How To Steal A Million (Role: David Leland) (Actor who got it: Eli Wallach) (Reason: Scott was hired for the role when Walter Matthau was deemed too expensive. Scott had been on the set for a few weeks before shooting began. However, on his first day of shooting, he didn't show up until after lunch, and director William Wyler decided to fire him. He was already finding it difficult to handle two heavy drinkers, Peter O’Toole andHugh Griffith, and the prospect of a third was just too overwhelming. On hearing of Scott's removal from the production, Audrey Hepburn became quite inconsolable.)

1967: In The Heat Of The Night (Role: Bill Gillespie) (Actor who got it: Rod Steiger) (Reason: Scott was offered and actually accepted the role of Bill Gillespie, However, according to producer Walter Mirisch's memoir ""I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History"". Scott backed out when wife Colleen Dewhurst wanted him to direct her in a play on Broadway. So Mirsch offered the role to Rod Steiger and he accepted)

1967: Wait Until Dark (Role: Roat) (Actor who got it: Alan Arkin) (Reason: Jack L. Warner wanted him for the role of Roat before deciding on Alan Arkin)

1970: Catch 22 (Role: Colonel Cathcart) (Actor who got it: Martin Balsam) (Reason: Scott turned down the role, stating that he already played the part in Dr. Strangelove)

1971: Dirty Harry (Role: Harry Callahan) (Actor who got it: Clint Eastwood) (Reason: Scott admitted in a 1980 Playboy Interview that he was offered the role of Harry Callahan but turned down the role because he didn’t like the script’s violent nature)

1971: McCabe & Mrs. Miller (Role: John McCabe) (Actor who got it: Warren Beatty) (Reason: He was considered for the role when Elliot Gould turned down role and Warner Bros preferred him for the role, but Altman ultimately decided to cast Warren Beatty)

1972: The Cowboys (Role: Will Anderson) (Actor who got it: John Wayne) (Reason: Was offered the role because Mark Rydell originally did not want to work with John Wayne, but John Wayne managed to convince him and Rydell admitted that he actually enjoyed working with John)

1972: The Godfather (Role: Vito Corleone) (Actor who got it: Marlon Brando) (Reason: Scott was considered for the role of Vito Corleone)

1972: Deliverance (Role: Unknown) (Reason: Scott was considered for a role in the film)

1976: Network (Role: Howard Beale) (Actor who got it: Peter Finch) (Reason: Scott reportedly turned down the role of Howard Beale)

1976: The Shootist (Role: J.B Brooks) (Actor who got it: John Wayne) (Reason: Scott was offered the role and reportedly he accepted the role on the condition that not word of the screenplay be changed but for reasons unknown, he didn’t play the part likely due to John Wayne campaigning hard for the part)

1999: Magnolia (Role: Earl Patridge) (Actor who got it: Jason Robards) (Reason: Scott was offered but turned it down after reading the script, calling it “The Worst f— Thing I’ve ever read, the language is terrible)

**I’m Still on a George C. Scott binge. I must admit, I wish Scott did more films like Patton in the 1970s. After great performances in Anatomy Of A Murder, The Hustler, Dr. Strangelove in the 70s, Scott achieved what I think is his greatest performance in Patton. However I feel after Patton, his film roles left something to be desired. I do hear great things about The Hospital & The Changeling and I did enjoy Hardcore, but when I see or hear of his other films in that era (Like Rage, The New Centurions, The Last Run, Day Of The Dolphin, Island Of The Stream, The Formula) , its “George C. Scott is great, even though the rest of the film is mid”. I will say his television films are top tier, Jane Eyre, The Price, Beauty & The Beast, A Christmas Carol, The Last Days Of Patton, 12 Angry Men Remake and others.** 

**I still think George C. Scott is a legend but I do wonder what would happen if he accepted any of the roles he turned down. (The Godfather & Deliverance are perfect castings, but I wonder on In The Heat of the Night, Network, The Shootist and Magnolia would have been an interesting if he accepted as it could have been his final film)**",movies

1nn90hm,200 Movie reviews (part 7),0,0.29,20,1758503109.0,True,"My goal this year is to watch 200 movies I have never seen before. As I go I am ranking them 1-10, and writing a few words on them. I'm not a movie critic, and my ratings are based on how much I enjoyed the film. Feel free to ask me anything, and give input and/or suggestions! I will be posting updates to this list of mine every 25 movies I watch.

Below is the link to part 6 of my list:

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/s/yGAQE9cazz

These are all MINI reviews! 

151. The Fly (1986): 6/10. Goldblum is such a weird dude, I think he was the perfect person for this job.

152. Training day: 7/10. Denzel funny.

153. Crouching tiger, hidden dragon: 8/10. Yeoh is great. The flying around was a little silly looking, but I got used to It. I really loved that last fight scene.

154. The toxic avenger: 5/10. For a reason I can't describe, this movie felt like it was made in the past 10 years, and only made to look like it was shot in the 80's. Felt like a high budget highschool project.

155. I'm gonna git you sucka: 3/10. just not very funny.

156. From dusk till dawn: 6/10. First time I ever disliked keitel. I actually kinda liked Tarantino. I would have LOVED going into this movie without knowing what it was about.

157. Blade: 8/10. Dude hell yeah, blade kicks ass. I like when he kills vampires. His outfit and haircut are fucking badass. He kills vampires really good.

158. Being john malkovich: 9/10. One of the most unique movies I have ever seen. I love everyone involved in this, especially malkovich and keener.

159. Phone booth: 5/10. I picked this because I felt like I was due for something awful, and I thought it looked the part. Was not as bad as I expected, but it wore out quickly and I didn't care about anyone.

160. The host: 7/10. Least favorite bong joon ho movie, still good. CGI was ugly. I don't get what sets this apart from other monster movies, I guess I'm not a monster movie guy.

161. Natural Born killers: 8/10. It was cool. thought I was gonna hate it at first, but Its weird look and tone clicked for me about 15 minutes in.

162. 2001: A space Odyssey. 10/10.

163. Barry Lyndon: 9/10. For such a long movie I don't think I blinked once. Kubrick might be my favorite director.

164. Mother!: 9/10. I have never been so frustrated and anxious throughout a movie. This is as close as any movie I have seen has come to emulating what having an actual nightmare is like. Didn't like Lawrence at first.

165. Joe Dirt 2: 1/10. I can't believe I watched this bullshit. The extended cut too, for some insane reason.

166. Jack and Jill: 2/10. 1 Star for existing, and 1 for Al Pacino. I actually laughed really hard when I saw Jared from subway, too. it was a jump scare.

167. Blair Witch 2: 1/10. Wasn't scary or funny or interesting or anything. My brain actually completely shut down while I watched this. It's insane how much they screwed this up.

168. Movie 43: 1/10. This is the only comedy I have ever watched where I didn't laugh once (I think).

169. Oldboy (2013): 6/10. Not as bad as I thought it would be. The action was bad and the movie really just didn't need to happen. Such an insane story, It's been years but I think the original is a 10.

170. The producers: 6/10. Springtime for Hitler was great. 

171. Tokyo!: 5/10. Interior design was The standout here. I didnt care about or like Merde at all. Shaking Tokyo was fine.

172. Life stinks: 5/10. It had it's moments. I liked the ending a lot. 

173. The fountain: 2/10. This BAD movie could have been GOOD if it did a better job at not being BAD (idk). Disappointed cause I really like everything else I have seen by arronofsky. 

174. L.A Confidential: 9/10. I was torn between a 9 and a 10 on this. There was a lot going on, and it slightly lost me a few times in the middle.

175. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind: 7/10. It wasn't what I was expecting. I like carrey here more than I ever have. ",movies

MY choice is Ghost Ship. I think I’ve watched that movie over 100 times and that ending scene will always just make me go ‘wtfffff’. Her in the ambulance on the port thinking the entire thing is over and that she’s safe. All of a sudden she sees her old crew carrying the gold crates onto the new ship..that incredibly intense song by Mudvayne starts rolling, and at the end of the pack is the demon who she thought she killed, slow motion walking up the deck behind them, peers over at her, nostrils flared while maintaining constant eye contact with her, then smirks at her and she screams ‘NOOOOOO!’ while the ambulance doors close on her  

Chills. Every. Single. Time.

Who doesn’t enjoy a good movie poster? As a teen, I plastered my walls with music posters by Frank Kozik and Coop. In college, I tumbled into a lifelong love affair with movie posters from around the world. 

I have a special love for hand-painted posters, as well as foreign posters for Hollywood films. Ghanaian movie posters, which you can [see and read about here](https://alexrollinsberg.substack.com/p/untamed-art-the-glorious-madness), tick both of these boxes. 

What are your favorite movie posters?

A quick history of these Ghanaian movie posters: The rise of home video brought movies to the most remote corners of western Africa. Mobile cinema operators crisscrossed the countryside, screening films in churches, homes, and open-air markets. To draw crowds, they needed eye-catching advertisements. But there was a problem: Ghana’s military government forbade the import of printing presses. So the mobile cinema operators turned to local artists, most of them self-taught sign painters.

Some had not yet seen the movies, while others had a selective regard for the characters and plots - adding guns, gore, and other salacious embellishments to lure audiences. Using recycled flour sacks as canvases and a mix of house and oil paints, they unleashed their eye-popping visions.

With the rise of the internet, cinema clubs faded away, and so too did the demand for hand-painted Ghanaian movie posters. Or so it seemed.

5,700 miles away in Chicago, Brian Chankin was running a tiny underground video store when a friend handed him a book called [*Ghanavision*](https://amzn.to/4ipviMF), a tribute to the obscure art form. He was mesmerized. Chankin started collecting the posters and hanging them in his shop. Customers clambered to buy them. As demand grew, Chankin decided to track down the artists. This was the dawn of his Chicago-based gallery, Deadly Prey, which has elevated local African poster artists to global sensations. ",movies

I’m sure I may have seen some of the ones that may be suggested for example ones that highlight the prison system, or about facing off against major corporations but please dont assume I’ve seen any and please give me a great list. …

I am also interested in showing some movies I’ve already seen and finding new ones to show some of my family and friends that may… benefit from looking at things from a wider and more humanist perspective. 

Thank you in advance 🥹🥹♥️

1nm8p1l,There’s something about chef films,2,0.55,30,1758400135.0,True,"I can’t be the only one right? Chef films are just some of the best films I’ve managed to watch despite being such a niche topic. I wanna use four examples to put my case forward. 

Ratatouille: undoubtedly the best Disney film out there and I’m genuinely scared for the new sequel coming out because if it’s as bad as 99% of sequels then imma lose it. It delves deep into the passion and love of food, how it’s more than nutrition and about connections, past, family, love and togetherness. Plus, a rat controlling an incapable human to cook is one of the best concepts for a film I can think of. Will never be topped. 

No Reservations: a step up from literal child’s play in Ratatouille but another brilliant example of an easy watch chef film. A Rom com told through the passion and determination of being a head chef. The good the bad the ugly of the workload and the cost of being the best. A love story in many ways and personally one of my favourites to rewatch. 

Burnt: the gritty example of being a chef. A truer demonstration of the cost of being the greatest, the sacrifices needed, the personality type required, the mental toll placed on them and for rewards only the best ever receive. One of true passion and a steep learning curve for those who are typically self absorbed and perfectionists. Never fails to keep my heart racing from the energy of the kitchen and the external stakes from Adam’s past. One of my favourite films. 

Chef: pursuing greatness when you are millimetres above rock bottom. But refusing to see that side because you have work to do. A different tempo and structure to the others which sees a slow revival of a world class chef building himself back up using the world outside of the kitchen. Another love story of the work he does, reconnecting with his son, his family, his past to create something out of pure passion and less about success. 

All of them have so much passion. I think that’s why I like them so much. All unique in their own ways but excel in their respective differences. It requires a certain person to be a chef and personally, I can’t cook for the life of me. I still think it’s a waste of time. But you don’t get that sense by watching these films. You live through a completely different perspective on a world people very rarely see. A deep dive into the workhouse of those striving to be the best at what they do. A ruthless environment where only the strongest survive. I don’t fully know what this says about me as a person but if you’ve not watched any of these films, I’d highly recommend it. 

Does anyone else have a similar feeling about chef films or is it just me who sits in awe at how the culinary world is portrayed in Hollywood? (Regardless of how inaccurate it may be)",movies

My two: 

“You built a time machine…out of a Delorean?” from Back to the Future.

The previous version made a grand statement about it being different to other kids' movies, which ended up with the comment section comparing to other movies that had similar themes. I want this to strictly be about Moana.

[This post from TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fridge/Moana) puts this into perspective:

>Why is it so important that Moana is the one to restore Te Fiti's heart, instead of Maui? Because she's human. Maui stole the heart because the humans of that time asked him to. This would also tie in nicely with Maui in Polynesian Mythology because most of his deeds were done because humans asked or complained about certain issues to him and he'd fix it. The line ""It's nice to see that humans never change"" could even be a stealth insult because this song is sung immediately after Moana demands that he help her return the heart. In fact the entire point of ""You're Welcome"" is secretly to show that humans are fickle and quick to demonise people; humans kept asking him to give them gifts, because it was never enough for them. No matter how amazing he was, it was never enough for people (""It was... never enough""). Finally, he made a mistake while trying to give the gift of life itself to humanity. From then on, how was he remembered? As a trickster god who screwed everyone, (""Maybe you were but now ... Now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti. The guy who cursed the world..."") That's why Moana was so surprised by the fact that he wasn’t a monster! She had no idea of all the good things he did. Maui was a guy whose only purpose was to make people happy but he made one mistake and was forever demonised by humanity.

And to add something myself, it's no secret that the most heinous villain isn't the non-humans, but the very much human >!Maui's parents who threw him to the sea. That event alone makes Maui understandably distance himself from his own humanity.!<

Not to mention:

>Te Fiti herself is demonised as Te Ka; no one knew that she was actually Te Fiti trying to get her heart back, she was demonised as well. People who told the story referred to her as being one of the demons who were hunting for the heart. When Moana sings ""Know Who You Are"" she sings ""***THEY*** have stolen the heart from inside you, but this does not define you"" Take note that she said they, she was never talking about Maui, she was talking about the humans themselves, the ones who kept asking Maui to give them more and more. That's why it's so important that Moana was the one to restore Te Fiti's heart and also be the one who helps Maui understand that he is so much more than what people define him as being. Because she is making up for the crimes that humans themselves have done.

1nm4wnu,"Some appearance In adaptations changes don’t matter, but others ruin the story",0,0.48,0,1758391019.0,True,"People shouldn’t believe that every complaint about changes to a character’s appearance in a new version or adaptation is valid. It only is when that change actually affects the story or alters something important about the character.

For example, an invalid complaint would be the live-action Little Mermaid, where a lot of people criticized the fact that Ariel is played by Halle Bailey, a Black actress, when the 1989 animated Ariel is white, red-haired, and blue-eyed. But whether you like that change or not, it doesn’t matter it doesn’t affect the story at all. Ariel could literally be blue and nothing about the plot would change.

On the other hand, a valid complaint would be most film adaptations of Carrie (Stephen King’s novel). In the book, Carrie White is described as a girl with pimples on her face, back, and other parts of her body; she’s also a bit overweight. These traits matter because they’re part of the reason she’s bullied. They’re not just cosmetic they are essential to her character. But in the movies, Carrie is usuallyportrayed as thin and conventionally attractive, with perfect skin.

Discussion about themes in Interstellar, Inception, Arrival, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind",0,0.33,6,1758429846.0,True,"My girlfriend and I just finished watching Inception and we have recently also watched Arrival, Eternal Sunshine, and Interstellar and started a discussion on which fate was worse and we wanted to bring it to reddit. All these movies have similar themes of time and memory alteration but each are different in the way the directors interpret this theme and how the main character experiences this. 

In Inception, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes through a life with his wife where they create an entire world and grow old together. He eventually comes back to a world where he is still young and where he succumbs to his regret and loses all sense of reality, as well as losing his wife to his own mistake. Yet he still gets to keep those memories and realities that he spent with his wife fake or not.

In Arrival, Louise (Amy Adams) gains the “gift” of being able to perceive time non-linearly from the aliens. This ability allows her to watch her daughter die of a disease she cannot stop. She is burdened with the knowledge of her and her daughters fate with no way of changing it. Despite that she doesn't let this consume her and she lives the way she would have regardless although the question is would you have the strength to do the same. 

In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel (Jim Carrey) has an entire relationship with a woman and has to witness these memories be removed from him. He can’t hide from it or escape it and in the end he has no memories of their time together except for this subconscious pull towards her. In the end they decide to start a relationship knowing that it ended before but only with recordings to look back on, recordings where they shamed each other. They will forever grieve the memories they have forgotten.

In Interstellar, Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) watches his family go through their lives and grow old without him and in the end he comes back to a world that is completely foreign and watches his young daughter die as an old woman. He grieves the life he was supposed to live and the memories he will never have. 

Although all these movies have some cathartic ending where all the characters accept and live with their realities, if you had to experience each, which do you believe is a worse fate?

1. Experiencing an entire life that you have created with someone just to come back knowing it was all fabricated and with a shattered grasp on reality. Grieving the memories that were never real.
2. Grieving the death of your daughter and marriage as your daughter is being born and as you meet your husband. Being burdened with the ability to experience every aspect of your life, past, present, and future, as if it is now. 
3. Going through the rest of your life having lost pieces of yourself you cant ever go back to and grieving memories that no longer exist in your conscious mind. You can continue a normal life but you still have a hole in yourself you will never be able to understand or fill, all you can do is wonder.
4. Choosing to take a leap of faith and to save humanity and as a result sacrificing the life you could have lived and the memories you could have had and only experiencing it through sparse messages filled with resentment for the choice you made. Coming back to a life filled with regret, where everything you knew is lost.",movies

1nmjuev,So….what happens to sloth after the events of “The Goonies”?,0,0.44,44,1758433145.0,True,"I just saw this movie again for the first time in like 20 years. It is a treasure. One problem though. 

The town is saved and everything is great, until you consider the events that would likely take place after the final scene: These are children who now are unknowingly stuck with the shared responsibility to be caregivers for a mentally disturbed and badly deformed man who also happens to be badly traumatized, has a razor thin threshold for anger, and also happens to be as strong as an ox? 

For those that don’t remember the ending off the top of their heads: in the climax of the goonies, the kids are trapped with 3 murderers on a pirate ship full of gold they need to save their town. Right when it seems like all is lost, Sloth, the overgrown deformity ridden 4th sibling to the murderers **(whom the other 3 had chained to the fucking wall in the fucking basement btw)** shows up to save the day! He beats up his murderer brothers and helps the kids escape the caves. The town is saved, and everyone is seen smiling and celebrating the saving of their town. 

With sloth. Sloth is directly included in the celebration because he was **crucial** to them all escaping with their lives. Which leads to my next question…

Who has to be the one to tell sloth he can’t actually chill with them? 

And how long would it take for them to be forced to make this horrible decision? 

Is chunk going to sit him down and explain the intricacies of teen adolescence to sloth? How would he even go about communicating such a nuanced concept to a man like sloth? How would you as a child communicate to sloth that they genuinely appreciate everything he did for them, but they are kids and they have lives to live. Sloth would start showing up everywhere they are. Having sloth around would invariably lead to social suicide. Sure the novelty would be funny and amusing at first. But what happens when the goonies are sitting around the house with Sloth watching football one day and a commercial comes on that tormented poor sloth endlessly **(while he sat chained to a fucking wall in a fucking basement btw)** and he starts breaking shit? Are we really supposed to believe in chunk’s or any of these children’s ability to essentially parent a mentally unstable man who could literally snap any one of them in half if the wrong synapse fires off. He would also be a serious drain in finances as well - which is the thing the kids were trying to fix the whole damn movie in the first place. Think of the therapy. The parents aren’t going to feel the same guilt as the children would, so I highly doubt they would squander their precious little money on 7-day a week therapy for poor sloth?

More importantly why aren’t people asking the hard questions like these anymore these days? Talk amongst ya selves!

>Why is it so important that Moana is the one to restore Te Fiti's heart, instead of Maui? Because she's human. Maui stole the heart because the humans of that time asked him to. This would also tie in nicely with Maui in Polynesian Mythology because most of his deeds were done because humans asked or complained about certain issues to him and he'd fix it. The line ""It's nice to see that humans never change"" could even be a stealth insult because this song is sung immediately after Moana demands that he help her return the heart. In fact the entire point of ""You're Welcome"" is secretly to show that humans are fickle and quick to demonise people; humans kept asking him to give them gifts, because it was never enough for them. No matter how amazing he was, it was never enough for people (""It was... never enough""). Finally, he made a mistake while trying to give the gift of life itself to humanity. From then on, how was he remembered? As a trickster god who screwed everyone, (""Maybe you were but now ... Now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti. The guy who cursed the world..."") That's why Moana was so surprised by the fact that he wasn’t a monster! She had no idea of all the good things he did. Maui was a guy whose only purpose was to make people happy but he made one mistake and was forever demonised by humanity.

Not to mention:

>Te Fiti herself is demonised as Te Ka; no one knew that she was actually Te Fiti trying to get her heart back, she was demonised as well. People who told the story referred to her as being one of the demons who were hunting for the heart. When Moana sings ""Know Who You Are"" she sings ""***THEY*** have stolen the heart from inside you, but this does not define you"" Take note that she said they, she was never talking about Maui, she was talking about the humans themselves, the ones who kept asking Maui to give them more and more. That's why it's so important that Moana was the one to restore Te Fiti's heart and also be the one who helps Maui understand that he is so much more than what people define him as being. Because she is making up for the crimes that humans themselves have done.

Obvious environmental message aside, kids' movies rarely give a blunt truth about humanity's greed or flaws. That's what makes Moana such a great movie. Possibly one of the top best Disney ever made.",movies

1nlneq0,Papillon: Cinema’s Greatest Story of Survival,5,0.63,5,1758338097.0,True,"Franklin J. Schaffner’s *Papillon* (1973), starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, has endured as a cinematic classic because it combines both the grit of survival storytelling with an intimate exploration of human resilience. Based on Henri Charrière’s autobiographical novel, the film tells the story of a man wrongfully imprisoned in the notorious French penal colonies of South America and his unbreakable will to escape. What makes it timeless is how it captures both the brutality of confinement and the transcendence of freedom, offering not just adventure but a deep meditation on the meaning of dignity, loyalty, and hope.

The performances alone elevate *Papillon* into the realm of the greatest films ever made. Steve McQueen delivers what is widely regarded as one of his finest roles, embodying Papillon’s fierce determination and unyielding spirit with a raw intensity that’s unforgettable. Hoffman provides the perfect foil as Louis Dega, bringing quiet humanity and fragile vulnerability to balance McQueen’s defiance. Their chemistry creates a bond that becomes the emotional heartbeat of the film, proving that even in the darkest places, friendship and solidarity can survive.

Beyond performances, *Papillon* is a triumph of atmosphere and storytelling craft. Its sweeping cinematography immerses viewers in both the oppressive isolation of the penal colonies and the wild beauty of the surrounding landscapes. The pacing, music, and set design convey the crushing weight of captivity while steadily building to moments of breathtaking escape and endurance. More than just an escape movie, *Papillon* resonates as an allegory for the indomitable human spirit, a story that continues to inspire across generations - cementing its place not just as a classic, but as one of the greatest films of all time.",movies

This isn't a terrible movie and it certainly isn't the worst in the Amityville line of movies. However, it's not good either. I wasn't expecting this movie to be like the original or the remake with Ryan Reynolds, but I also wasn't expecting it to be so badly written/acted. There are some tense moments in this movie that are good, but they don't make up for the rest of the mediocrity. The scene where the brother is asking the older sister to kill him via a voice chat/computer thing is creepy, but if there is a good scene, just expect about 3-4 bad scenes to make up for it. 

IDK if there is a proper way to do an Amityville movie. Many production companies and directors and writers have tried, but not very many have succeeded and I'm unsure of why that is. Is it the subject topic? Is it the writers that have given it a try? Or maybe films around this topic are cursed in someway. Whatever it is, I still hope one day that someone can do a really good Amityville movie because I feel like, if done properly, the Amityville story can become a huge successful and interesting story to tell.",movies

It drives me insane. Most of the time they trash talk the OG character which makes them 10× worse and more annoying. Like bro, I don’t care how flawed the original was, they earned their stripes. You didn’t. Shut up and sit down.

I can think of a few examples like: Boruto after Naruto, Harrison in Dexter: New Blood, Scrubs season 9 med students, Raiden in MGS2, Dani in Terminator: Dark Fate, the Inuyasha sequel girls, etc. Every time it happens, it feels like lazy writing that disrespects the legacy of the original character.

1nlizno,Leaving Las Vegas -1995,10,0.65,2,1758325016.0,False,"I watched it for the first time last night, and I felt compelled to share my thoughts in the hope that someone else who loves/has loved someone with a severe drinking problem, finds solace in this film as much as I do. Sera's perspective has give me clarity about a similar experience I had, with a severe alcoholic boyfriend, 20 years ago.

In my humble opinion, the film is a spot-on reflection of what it's like to love an alcoholic, especially a suicidal alcoholic. Like Sera, I (subconsciously) liked my boyfriend's drama...and I liked feeling needed by someone who was so fragile. Like Sera and Ben, we clicked very early on, and the relationship was evolved quickly...we both decided to be exclusive shortly after the first time we hung out. I could relate to Sera's sympathy and desire to make Ben happy despite his death wish. I remember the times my boyfriend and I spent together that were spoiled by his drunkeness. I sympathized with Sera when she asked Ben to see a specialist. It was a painful lesson to learn that loving an alcoholic; doing everything you can to help them...the sacrifices, the patience...it did not matter. I wasn't enough for my boyfriend to stop drinking, like Sera wasn't enough for Ben to stop drinking.

I knew how Sera felt as she watched Ben's light grow fainter and fainter, until there was nothing left. My heart fully broke during the scene where Ben has a major hangover (link attached). Despite the spasms, the consistent vomiting, the tremors, poor sleep, and lack of appetite...mixed with his determination to die, shows the brutally high caliber of the disease. And still, Ben reaches for the alcohol to cope.

However, the silver lining in the film, for me at least, is Sera's words to her therapist (assuming she's speaking with a therapist). She acknowledges that even though she knew the relationship with Ben would go nowhere, and that it was a toxic situation for both of them, she genuinely loved him, and he loved her...as much as he could. Her experience with Ben, in a way, saved her life... because by talking about her painful experiences, she is coping with and exploring her emotions. Her insight about herself, shows she has begun her journey down the inevitable (and painful) path of grief. 

Sera's words are what I've been thinking about for the past 20 years...I just didn't know how to articulate them. I still grieve for my boyfriend all of these years later, but the grief has lightened SIGNIFICANTLY after watching this film. I hope it helps other people who have had a similar experience (:

Davis even says he never really loved his wife, so I don’t see his destruction as grief-driven. To me, it’s more of an existential dissection of his auto-pilot life upheld by routine and the death of his wife is just the catalyst. The scaffolding falls away and suddenly he has to confront the reality that his life has no intrinsic meaning. Since he did whatever was ""easy,"" the same response he gave when someone asked him why he married her as humans are naturally conditioned to choose the easier choice. No one likes to be uncomfortable. And by tearing things apart, he’s really trying to strip his own life to its core, to see what’s real.

That's my analysis at least because it resonates heavily with me, as I also been on autopilot for decades as most high achieving people do. Because to get to that point in life of high achieving careers, you have to sacrifice so much of yourself and go on autopilot to grind, to do the routine, to climb the corporate ladder, to climb the path in medicine, this hierarchical structural system that takes decades of time.

This is a complicated question for any movie buff such as myself, but if I were to put a name to it, I’d 100% choose Robert Duvall.

1nm406v,Why does James Bond order a vodka martini instead of a gin martini?,0,0.37,42,1758388869.0,True,"​Hey everyone,

​I've always been fascinated by James Bond.
He's the epitome of a British agent: he drives an Aston Martin, wears Savile Row suits, and his entire persona represents English sophistication. 

But there's one thing that's always confused me: his iconic drink.

​We all know his legendary line, ""vodka martini, shaken, not stirred,"" but doesn't it seem a bit contradictory? Gin, with its long history and deep cultural connection to England, would seem like the most logical choice for a character who embodies British culture.

​Yet, Bond insists on vodka, a drink with strong ties to Russia, Poland, France, etc. But not GB. 

Is this just a character quirk? Or is there a deeper reason? Perhaps a subtle detail from his creator, Ian Fleming?

​I'd love to hear what you all think. Do you see it as an insignificant detail, a strategy to set him apart, or is there a hidden symbolism in his choice?",movies

I loved how the documentary doesn't just focus on the performance but shows Paul Reubens' vulnerability and creativity. The balance of humor and honesty is incredible, rarely do documentaries make me smile this much while also appreciating the artistry involved.

I didn't expect to get teary-eyed at parts, honestly. Also, the pacing is perfect, never dull, always engaging. Can we talk about how Reubens' energy is still so infectious? Seriously, it's like Pee-Wee never left us.",movies
1nm48xt,Hollywood Can’t Rely on Decades Old IP Solely. They Need Originals for Today’s People. Not All Originals Are Flops,0,0.32,14,1758389442.0,True,"Inside Out and Coco became new IP out of original ideas. The fact that people complain about Pixar only doing sequels are honestly blinded by nostalgia. Pixar has made more original movies this decade so far and there are two more coming out with some eye catching premises.

Hoppers has a teenage girl swapping bodies with a beaver. And I’m sure that was a sellable hook more than Elio which people complained about being generic or having the bean mouth style.

Elemental became a sleeper hit due to word of mouth and it did better than most of Disney’s 2023 slate.

Hexed is coming out from Disney Animation and it might do better than Strange World and Wish. Might be a modest hit on the levels of Encanto if the premise and characters are a draw.

Gatto will likely make a dent because of a black cat as the selling point including the Italian setting and anyone who enjoyed Luca on Disney+.

Besides Disney, newer IP got a theatrical adaptation like Minecraft which did numbers.

Several award bait movies, horror/thriller movies and indie films are pulling in audiences into theaters. This year, Sinners, F1, Weapons, and Materialists are making records.

A24 and Neon are putting out films that do spark conversation amongst moviegoers.

Even if films don’t do well in theaters, they have a second life on PVOD, streaming and physical media.

Honestly, the discourse around movies like Elio have led to this nihilism including myself. I got to look at facts and reality. Studios need original movies to create new franchises and to get new filmmakers further into the industry. At some point, franchise fatigue will hit any legacy IP if they are churning out too much of it.

Sure, some legacy IP can still stay around to provide studios a safety net for future investment. Yet, original movies are still a demand as much as franchises and remakes.",movies

1nku11s,Hardcore (1979) is overlooked,51,0.8,16,1758256105.0,True,"I went on a George C. Scott binge recently, and I came across Hardcore. This film is really interesting, it is about a father whose teenage daughter goes missing in California and turns up in a porno film. This leads him to search for her and leads him into the subculture of pornography. 

I got to say, I honestly think this film is overlooked & underrated. What makes the film is George C. Scott and his performance as the father, Jake van Horn, who immerses himself into the industry we would never dare go into, just so that he could find his daughter. George C. Scott is just a good actor, who always commits himself to the role and always is the best part of anything he is in. Season Hubley is also great as Joanne, a prostitute who help Jake find his daughter. What I like is that Joanne and Jake found a grudging respect for each other, in spite of the cultural differences between them. Also good was Peter Boyle as the private investigator

However, I did feel that the ending was a bit of a letdown, which I found predictable. I did read that Paul Schrader was forced to change the ending from what he originally intended it to be.

The comics could be funny but in a more morbid sense. It was satirical, smart, violent, mature, but never went too over-the-top with its grotesque nature.

So... During Cage's last chance in Paris, he told the J-Squad not to kill an alpha because if it's killed, time will be reset.

Cage would probably be reset to the scene in the helicopter where he was going to meet General Brigham.

Mine would be:

- The “groundhog day” 

I’ve probably seen most of the movies that use this plot device (edge of tomorrow, Palm Springs, run Lola run, happy death day, source code etc), but no matter how well they’re done, it always feels like a drag to me. Like it just always comes off as too gimmickey…

- The family member gets separated 

Oftentimes it’s the child from the parents, so that sets up the rest of the plot going forward. This is used in a variety of genres as well and it never does it for me. No notes, it just doesn’t do it for me lol.

1nlq7fx,'Oppenheimer' (2023) leaves you in awe.,0,0.43,29,1758347424.0,True,"Watched the film for the 3rd time recently and it continues to amaze with how much it accomplishes. You don't fully grasp the film on the first watch. It is incredible how much story Nolan packs in the 3 hour runtime.

It's a film about Oppenheimer the scientist, the man, the political figure, but it's also about the Manhatten project, it's about Strauss vs Oppenheimer, it's about determination of scientists to keep on pushing boundaries (which is not always for the best), it's about how the machinery builds heroes only to spit them out when their usefulness is over, among other things.

And all this is shown by employing a majestic score, impeccable acting, inspired editing which reminds you of the great editing work done in JFK (1991) and great cinematography. It's a film where 90% of it is about a few people talking in small rooms but the film always feel epic in scope.

Now the film has faults and is not perfect. The problem of music overpowering dialogue still is a feature of a Nolan film here and has not justification. Similarly, Nolan should have explained some aspects a bit better because some character names or events come up here of which the audience is expected to be on the know but isn't always the case. When a film requires a bit of outside research to grasp the film fully, that is not the ideal scenario.

Nolan has made many good films and a couple of questionable films too but I think Oppenheimer might just be his best which shows he is just getting better and better. It's a film that I see enduring for long.",movies

1nkdqbp,Who is someone in real life (that most people haven’t heard of) whose story is so compelling it could be turned into an amazing movie?,86,0.76,206,1758214504.0,True,"My vote would be Walter Harper. This guy was a total bad ass. He was the first person to ever summit Denali. After that he followed his passion and was accepted to medical school in Philadelphia. This is made more impressive because as an Alaska Native he was breaking racial stereotypes and barriers of the time (1920s.)

Add the horrific and harrowing tale of his passing it would make a summer blockbuster. He and his wife, just married, were on a ship traveling from Skagway to Seattle to begin their journey to med school in Philadelphia. Their ship, the SS Princess Sophia, hit a reef and was grounded during a storm at night. Although several other ships came to their rescue they couldn’t help due to the weather, darkness and danger of the reef. The other ships watched helplessly as the SS Sophia slipped off the reef after a night of terror killing all 364 (to this day the PNW’s worst maritime disaster) people onboard. The only survivor was a dog that swam to shore. 

Harper’s life has a bunch of crazy things that each one could be a movie. The first to summit North America’s tallest mountain, getting in to med school at a time when racial prejudice was rampant and normal and dying in such a dramatic fashion. But most of all, he died at just 25. His whole life in front of him. A massive loss of potential.

Let me start by saying this movie does a ton of foreshadowing and pre-planning in the details on the first viewing. 

One thing I have NOT been able to figure out is why/how does Teddy not realize he’s going back to the island? 

I imagine the assumption come the end of the movie is that the island sends him away for US Marshal purposes, and he comes back to the island for the purpose of a case. 

But would Teddy not realize that he’s going to the same place he just came from? And to a lesser extent, his “partner” Chuck? (I say to a lesser extent because the film assumes that in the alternate personality of Teddy, Chuck is a character in his story and he blocks out the reality of Andrew so from that perspective it makes sense that Chuck would be there). 

I love this movie to death but for the life of me I can not figure out how it opens with Teddy on the ferry and come the end of the movie we’re either supposed to make the assumption of why he was on the ferry to begin with, or it just makes sense anyway. ",movies

I’ve seen a lot of people hating on the movie since it came out and I just want to say I thoroughly disagree with that. You’re not going to go into a movie like this expecting a cinematic masterpiece, but it’s incredibly fun for what it is. It’s so tonally different from the first one that you could probably watch the second as a stand-alone film and still enjoy it. Bob Odenkirk is amazing as usual, expectedly, and if you only think of him or have seen him as Saul Goodman, then you’ll be pleasantly surprised to realize how excellent he is as an action star. 

Anyway, this film is funny, over the top, and just overall short and sweet. It doesn’t have a strong plot of course but in no way does that set it apart from others of its genre. The kills are great too. Overall, I think people are too quick to hate and this movie doesn’t deserve that. If you liked the first, or even if you haven’t seen it, well first of all you should go watch it, but do be sure to check this one out as well. You won’t regret it.

One example that comes to mind is 2008’s “Speed Racer.” The film is not meant to be taken super-seriously, but I still remember the vibe back then feeling like people thought the Wachowskis had lost their minds, making vomiting candy-coating all over their film. Some I remember saying how they should have made a darker and grittier Speed Racer, hardened and traumatized by Rex’s death.

I also feel there was a greater element of “if this movie doesn’t work logically it sucks” out there, especially with something like 2008’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”

I remember people poking so many holes in that, as if to say unless it’s serious and logical, it’s a poor film. The amount of hate about the fridge scene felt so ridiculous…given so many of these people accepted the raft scene in “Temple of Doom” as kids without a second thought.

Some Reviews:

[HighOnFilms - Liam Gaughan](https://www.highonfilms.com/one-battle-after-another-2025-movie-review/) \- 5 / 5

>“One Battle After Another” is a hyperkinetic thrill ride that surprisingly never loses momentum throughout its nearly three-hour running time, yet never feels weighed down by its scope. The action has the same eye-popping practicality of “John Wick” or “Mad Max: Fury Road,” with the charm that none of its characters are particularly skilled. DiCaprio often appears as a bumbling hero in the vein of Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, even if he shows a capacity for delivering snarky one-liners not seen since his work in “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

[BBC - Caryn James](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250917-one-battle-after-another-review) \- 5 / 5

>Salman Rushdie, reviewing Pynchon's Vineland 35 years ago, called it ""a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself."" And at a Q&A with Anderson several weeks ago, Steven Spielberg praised the film as ""increasingly more relevant than perhaps even when you finished the screenplay"". American society, in all its strengths and missteps, has been a major theme for both Pynchon and Anderson, and it grounds Anderson's dazzler of a film, giving it an emphatic, unmistakable political charge.

>Ambitious, urgent and personal storytelling from Paul Thomas Anderson, blending many different genres to create an engaging and vital new masterwork. Relentless pacing, strong performances, technical and visual excellence, with multi-layered depth and inspiring relevance to bring about change for our overwhelmingly dark times.

>Even the things PTA whole-cloth invented for the film, like the harmony transponders, Bob forgetting the code words, the Christopher Reeve Superman poster in Sensei Sergio’s dojo, semen demon, the car chases, the stunt fall off a building down a tree… There are so many little details, seemingly inconsequential touches – the filmmaker’s style, if you will – that all add up bit by bit to turn this amazing movie into a masterpiece.

[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-1235151707/) \- 'A'

>With “One Battle After Another,” Anderson concedes that he’s no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/17/one-battle-after-another-review-paul-thomas-andersons-thrillingly-helter-skelter-counter-culture-caper) \- 5 / 5

>One Battle After Another is at once serious and unserious, exciting and baffling, a tonal fusion sending that crazy fizz across the VistaVision screen – an acquired taste, yes, but addictive. The title itself hints at an unending culture war presented as a crazily extreme action movie with superbly managed car chases and a final, dreamlike and hypnotic succession of three cars through the undulating hills. And is the central paternity crisis triangle an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream? Maybe. These ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now, which only makes this film more interesting: it is about dissent and discontent, and the lonely heroism of not fitting in.

[RogerEbert - Brian Tallerico](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-battle-after-another-movie-review-2025) \- 4 / 4

>It’s also, crucially, a deeply humanist movie. Anderson cares about these characters deeply. Bob’s frustration becomes our own, as does his concern for Willa. So many “films of our moment” have felt angry or cynical, but Anderson’s movie transcends that by being human and even offering optimism. It’s not one loss after another. It’s one battle. Keep fighting.

>From one generation to the next, the struggle endures. Fierce and unrelenting, Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” burns as both an incendiary action epic and a tender family drama, alive with humor, conviction, and revolutionary spirit. And amid all its pandemonium, Sergio’s reminder that “freedom is no fear” lingers as the film’s quiet truth, a mantra passed down like a torch. Few films this year feel so vital, so breathtaking in scope and soul. Viva la revolución, indeed.

>“One Battle After Another,” as a major studio release clattering with straightforward representations of racism, xenophobia and vigilantism, is an exception in almost every way to modern-day Hollywood. I’m sure that will bring debate, just as any good movie does. And I’m sure some will find its American portrait muddled and chaotic. But those aspects feel true, too, just as does the movie’s abiding fighting spirit.

[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1661135/greatest-character-actors-all-time-ranked/) \- 10 / 10

>I don't think anyone would classify Anderson as an action filmmaker, but ""One Battle After Another"" is propulsive, loaded with shootouts and a lengthy car chase finale that's so intense and exciting that I felt like I was going to get out of my seat and start pacing around the theater to calm the hell down. Are you even allowed to make movies like this anymore, on this sort of grand scale? I don't know, but Paul Thomas Anderson has done it. Viva la revolución.

>For all of *One Battle After Another*’s formalist pleasures – its humour, its pace, its grandeur – what feels the most striking about it, in this apocalyptic now, is the hope that it chooses to leave us with. Every battle, out on the streets and inside hearts, will have been worth it one day.

>Yes, an all-powerful government might be sending soldiers to its citizens’ doorstep, but *One Battle After Another* is about once-dispirited people searching for the will to best and survive them—perhaps regardless of whether their means are moral. More often than not, they succeed. So, too, does the film: It’s an emotional, visceral triumph.

1nlh51l,Kingsman : The Secret Service (2014),0,0.37,7,1758320180.0,True,"

Man where do I start?

For one, this movie totally took me by surprise. Had it not been playing as I was at a friends house I’d have never gave it a chance.

Like Valentine, I’ve always been a huge fan of the bond films. 

I wanted to be bond. I’d wake up at 6am before school every morning and watch Golden Eye religiously while I drank my coffee.

Pierce Brosnan’s Bond was my role model and affected how I carried myself and how I viewed myself. 

The choreography.
Right at the jump there’s some great action to likes of John Wick with Lancelot showing up and with his suave demeanor and lines 
I could tell right off the bat, 

This is bond. A self aware copy cat but damn good nailing the bond persona and I bought it.

And with choreography like this this is sure to be 10/10 bond movie because none of James Bond films actually have any action close to what is displayed in the first few minutes of this opening scene

I could have easily watched the entire run time with just Lancelot.

But then plot twist he’s split in fucking half! 

By an even more badass foe

Gazelle. 

Don’t know if I’ve ever seen a more badass henchmen than Gazelle. 

I’m not sure what her motivations are which add intrigue. Whenever she’s on screen I try get a read on her

Not sure what her motivations are but we don’t need to know her motives for this work.

She is Valentine’s right hand and personal body guard.

A femme fatale in the true sense of the term. 

Lancelot was a badass. Took out a room of goons John Wick style with ease and then our expectations are subverted as he’s split in half

No plot armor here. 

And what I like about kingsman is that it really is an agency of people just like Bond. So you can have multiple James Bond like characters.

In Golden Eye I always thought 006 was kind of a wasted opportunity.

I always found it fascinating seeing Bond with another 00 in the opening of Goldeneye 

It felt realistic. For these insane missions I feel like you’d send at least a few or at least a couple competent agents and not just one man.

Making the Bond movies lean into the unstoppable one man army trope.

We only get to see Bond with 006 for a few minutes but I totally bought it and I totally bought Bonds anger and grief as his fellow 00 is gunned down in front of him

But since then I always wondered “where are the rest of the 00’s?” 

Why is Bond the only one we ever see? If this is an agency then surely you’ve got more agents that should be just as capable.

So in my head canon I just always assumed there were other agents on their own missions and were just seeing things involving Bond. Even though that’s not true.

But with multiple kingsman you can actually have some die but somewhat realistic here. 

Bottom line : Bond doesn’t really die but kingsmen can.
Which raises the stakes

And of course I love the self awareness. The old Bond movies are even brought up mid conversation between Galahad and Valentine 

Valentines plot/conspiracy theory/realism 

Was heavy into conspiracy theories at the time and I 100% bought what Valentine was doing and chalked up his plot to disclosure.

Something that could  and most likely is happening.

Maybe not exactly as portrayed in the film but close enough. In fact too close for comfort.

Valentines motivations are 100% logical and also too close for comfort. Asking the audience if what he’s doing is actually the right thing to do. 

His mentality is also interesting.

He’s gives off a vibe of a nerd that was picked on in school, he’s a black man with a hip hop style with the baseball cap to the side. 

A gimmick but adds to his character. And he could easily be anyone of our tech giants today. Elon Musk. Zuckerberg. Bezos. 

He’s an exaggerated version of any one of these people and that’s what really brings it home. 

How far fetched really is someone like Richmond Valentine? 

If you ask me, not far at all…
And this part of what I like about even just this one character. 

The motivations : this “villain” in this narrative is actually trying to save the world. 

And from we’ve gathered from global warming and climate change it doesn’t look like things are going to get better and like Galahad says in the movie… 

We’re going to feel the effects no matter what we do at this point.



And that’s real.
Adding actual meaning to a character and the movie as a whole. 

Are the Kingsmen really in the right here? Sure Valentine and all his corrupt baddies are dead. But as it stands, the earth is still overpopulated and prone to negative impacts 

Valentine was trying to save the world long term. While the kingsmen saved the world… but only for today.

Which asks us all that question 

Are we going to stand up for what’s right even if it results in our destruction long term?

In the kingsmen’s eyes that answer is yes.

And again, I love Valentines character. He can’t stomach violence yet is the mastermind behind this mass culling. It’s brilliant!

He isn’t a psychopath.
Can’t praise this character enough.

The cull. With all major world leaders, an elite 1% and our own president waiting idle while the planet commits mass homicide I can’t help but believe this is exactly what would happen if not will.

And the free SIM cards. Like the saying goes “if it’s free, you are the product”

Like Facebook, was free and took the world by storm only later to be accused of spying and archiving your information even after you delete or deactivate.


Edward Snowden, blowing the whistle on the NSA conducting mass surveillance in the masses and using our personal devices in unethical ways.

The literal free phones everywhere now. You only need and ID and SS number to get a free smart phone free of charge.


I’m not saying that our SIM cards are going mind control is into harming each other for a mass culling but there’s clearly some similarities here.


I could go on and on about this movie but this post would be too long. 

The church scene is an epic feat of cinema. By far one the most amazing fight sequences in a movie that I’d put in comparison to Zack Snyder’s BVS Batman warehouse fight.

Have you ever seen an elite agent go postal and go through 40 people? 

Well, you have now. 

This scene truly demonstrates how deadly a Kingsman is. 

Valentine is a true A tier villain. Outsmarting the Kingsmen and Harry.

The look on Harry’s face when Valentine walks out of the changing booth at the tailor shop with the musical que says “gotcha”

Was cool to see a kingsman outplayed like that.

The dialogue is great. 
“Professor Arnold… ya know not a lot of people knew about him…. You like spy movies Mr.Devere?…”

“Lox as in smoked fish?” 

“As in…locked up” 

And… Valentine killed Harry (at least not counting the other films to a certain point they weren’t made yet)

And playing it for a sick joke. 
Your blown away Valentine just killed one of the main characters but can’t help but chuckle that Valentine needs to turn away and ask Gazelle if he’s dead playing into his character

And the end fight is just more icing on the cake like I said I could go on and on. 

Haven’t seen Golden Circle yet

Now I do know that is the intention of most media, to get you to feel a characters pain, but I feel it almost to a personal level to the point of where a scene like that make me almost mournful for days as if I had actually lost someone I loved.
Now I know about the term ""empath"" but people you call themselves empaths tend to be dramatic being like "" oh im an empath so I can feel you pain"" to generalize them being rude and not truly empathetic. Is there another term for what I feel?

1nllcob,Why is everyone so damn stupid in The Departed?!,0,0.36,17,1758331816.0,True,"
Don’t get me wrong, Scorsese is a master filmmaker, and the movie is entertaining and well written in terms of the flow and keeping the audience engaged. Characters have great dialogue and the acting is on point…

But holy crap everyone is so damn stupid! (IMO)

A breakdown of why that is in no special order, just how I remember these events and why they make no sense;

- Sullivan is caught several times on suspicious phone calls, calling family during a sting when there’s clearly a rat in the unit? Or the lawyer scene when he turns off the camera and used the other cops phone to have the perp call Costello? 
- Queenan is absolutely sure he’s not being followed when he goes to meet at 344 Wash? He goes to some weird meet on the rooftop of a building and makes no calls, doesn’t tell Dignam, doesn’t make a call to the department to let them know, nothing, just waits to be killed?
- The police boys in the car following Queenan know something is up, and follow Sullivan’s orders and it never occurs to anyone that Sullivan is the rat?
- Captain Ellerby fires Dignam over the suspicious Sullivan?The guy with all the locked files, leaving the undercovers to rot? 
- He trusts Sullivan more than Dignam who’s been there longer?? Who is obviously the one can testify the most to Queenans not being a rat? 😳 
- Even Costello, what, he trusted Costigan more than anyone else? Why the hell would he? Because of that conversation at the bar? Dude is new, Sullivan has shown him nothing but loyalty, it makes no sense to me.


But the worst of all is Costigan IMO…
Holy cow,
- When he’s following Sullivan down the alleyway what the hell is that? His phone rings (of course he didn’t put it on mute during an important undercover investigation), and he has a gun, but doesn’t run up on the guy and arrest him.
- He tells Queenan about it, but Queenan or Costigan have no interest in using their minds to check street cameras? How long does it take Sullivan to get to the precinct after that? Costigan can’t call Queenan and be like “check the tapes right now he’s been spotted on camera!” ? Would take 2 seconds!
- He goes to the precinct and is obviously believed right away as he’s placed in a cubicle waiting to be paid out. All he has to do is talk to the other cops!
- when he sees Sullivan on the computer, all he has to do is stop the guy and call the other cops over. Sure he’ll get arrested but with a bunch of screaming about look at the computer, look at my file, they’ll see it right away!
Instead he allows Sullivan to erase his file and flees. 
- He’s given all the Costello tapes and his only idea is to apprehend Sullivan a million miles away from safety?
How hard would it be to go to a lawyer and go together to the precinct? He knows who the rat is, it’s not Ellerby, just go to him and bring the tapes. Done. With everything he knows and his story it’ll be absolutely easy to place Sullivan as the rat.


- Now back to Dignam, the one guy who can help Costigan, a detective, can’t find Costigan on his own when he leaves the unit to team up with him? What in the hell, dude, your guy is out there all alone!
After Costello dies, just find the fucking guy it can’t be all that hard. Leave word with someone, something! 
No contingency plan, just screw Costigan, he’s on his own.
- And yet with all he knows, and can prove, he won’t go to the precinct and explain things to Ellerby. He instead performs a hit on Sullivan and allows the rat to get a bagpipe funeral with all the trimmings.
I thought Dignam was smaht and just playing bad cop for some reason the whole time. Queenan needed someone like Dignam I thought, that’s why let’s him run his mouth, as a mindfuck to keep people in line.
Think about it, how many times does Queenan stay quiet and lets Dignam put pressure on Costigan, then comes in real nice and tells him, “Do this for me?” Queenan was either using Billy, or was an idiot and the way he died tells me he wasn’t smaht.

Anyway, Dignam was really just an asshole the whole time and I think Dignam only killed Sullivan over Queenan. He had no interest in helping Costigan, his beef with him was real the whole time.

I won’t get into the therapist. I can’t even wrap my head around how she was assigned Costigan (assigned by who?!) when she normally doesn’t see people like him, but nobody thinks to go to her when shit falls apart.

I don’t know man, I love the Departed as a movie. It’s really awesome! But it’s also filled with the dumbest people I’ve ever seen in a movie of this type.

Or can you give me a reason I’m not seeing why this was supposed to be this way? Maybe I’m not getting something, a hidden meaning in the film that is about the stupidity or vulnerability of mankind?

I don’t know… Maybe I’m just not that smaht…",movies

Dakota was insanely pretty as a person, and her acting shone equally bright on the screen. I could have easily watched her for another hour. Both male actors were good in their roles, though their parts felt smaller compared to everything else happening. It was the best kind of “average” movie, with a very up-to-date theme. I liked how it intertwined capitalism, dating, and the awful sides of human nature together. It’s the combination of things that defines us rather than just one!

The metamorphosis of emotions in these lines—or the realization of them—sums up the whole movie:

I try to avoid pretty much all marketing about a movie because of spoilers.  I finally got around to watching Sinners, only knowing that Michael B. Jordan looked pretty badass in it and that it had a lot of critical acclaim.  

So imagine my surprise when they do a whole Dusk Till Dawn twist on us.  It's so rare for a movie to change genres halfway through, and seems even harder to keep that a secret especially today with rampant dissecting of trailers and entertainment news and everything else. 

Afterward, I was really curious about how this movie was marketed because of the twist.  And okay, sure, it's not a big abrupt twist because they clearly set up the supernatural stuff from the start....but up until a certain point the movie stays pretty solidly about gangsters doing gangster shit.

I watched the 2nd trailer for this on YouTube, and I was surprised to see a lot of spoilers.  They clearly show it's a vampire movie which okay....I guess you want people to know what they're getting into.  But they specifically show Hailee Steinfeld turned and sexing up one of the B. Jordans.  Then they even show that B. Jordan turned behind the door.  Like those are some major character ""deaths"" (shoutout to the epilogue) that are straight up revealed in the trailer.

They even spoil Cornbread, which in the movie is played to make the audience 2nd guess it.

I can't believe this is really the world we're living in.  I can't imagine how much would have been taken away from my viewing experience already knowing that one of the brothers was going to die/turn (even though you kind of expect and fear it going into the situation but that creates tension through the whole thing because you worry it *could* happen).  

I also remember enjoying the twist of Dusk Till Dawn, and was always happy I didn't know anything about it going into it.  So even though I can understand wanting to know ""Oh this is a vampire movie"" ahead of time, I personally wouldn't want to know.  But showing which main characters become vampires seems like going way too far with spoilers.",movies

1njrf7h,"""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a magical movie. So fucking quoteable. So melancholic and profound. Also everybody's acting is perfect.",148,0.89,52,1758148397.0,True,"It's been a couple years since I've seen it so I was nice and fresh for a rewatch. Man it hits so fucking high. I forget how good the dialouge in this movie is. ""That fucking nurse man...she ain't honest"", ""I'm not as big as you Mac""

It really, really makes me wanna sit down and read the book. I can just feel how much context is missing from these incredible characters backgrounds. I also assume the book is set in the 50's? Because they never mention a time frame for the movie so I assume it happens in the 70's, but everything about the settting feels like the 50's


I wanted to say this is Jack Nichelsons best performance, but I'm conflicted cause I also love The Shining. But honestly, everybody's great in this. I can't think of a single person who wasn't giving a top notch performance.


It's an incredible story. If you judge the plot purely by the events that happen, everything becomes worse by McMurphy arriving to the hospital. Objectively, Mac's a bad person. He has a long rep sheet, he even says I fuck and fight too much. His antics lead to a lot of bad shit happening.


And yet he's exactly what those poor bastards needed to take a break from that domineering nurse and the cold, sterile enviorment she created.

But I am looking for a nude scene that does have this type of purpose.   
  
My example would be the shower scene in Starship Troopers. The male-female shower scene isn’t just meant to shock. It symbolizes the strict, controlled society in the movie, where the government dominates everyone’s life. By showing both men and women together, it highlights that all citizens, regardless of gender, are equally subjected to the harsh, dehumanizing rules of the military system (That is Verhoeven's interpretation) ",movies

1nkiikn,I just finished watching all 9 Jesse Stone movies with Tom Selleck in the lead!,4,0.59,3,1758225288.0,True,"I watched the first one almost 5 years ago, then I decided to binge all the movies at this point! Here are my little thoughts.

*Jesse Stone* is a detective series, and each movie usually has two storylines: a main plot and a subplot. It's always about murders, but it's not that really dark. It can really go down easily, like, it feels like you're watching an extended TV episode for each movie, with pretty much the same formula. That’s the exact vibe of the whole series. It's definitely made for older audiences who are fans of Tom Selleck. It also feels a bit old-fashioned.

Those movies definitely had cheap production, but all of them were pretty formulaic. I loved the autumn and chilly vibes, like, they really nailed the cinematography in some movies. The small-town setting can be enjoyable. The storyline about a mother who searches for the child who was kidnapped from a hospital just one day after birth 7 years ago, might be my favorite storyline in the whole series.

Jesse plays a police chief with a drinking problem, and you can basically smell the whiskey on him. But he takes his job seriously, and that’s what I liked about him. He was a solid lead. Surprised to see that he hasn't acted in any movies since the last *Jesse Stone* movie.

The last movie didn’t really feel like a final chapter, though, but it feels about right to be the current last one, in my opinion. After all 9 movies, I was just ready to move on. I see they've kept trying to make *Jesse Stone 10* happen for years, but I really don't know if it will ever happen. I would be happy to watch another one, though. However, I’d say it’s a solid 7/10 series.

Right now it kinda feels like horror is the only genre really thriving. Low budget, high profit, and people actually show up for them in theaters.

Superhero fatigue feels pretty real and studios don’t seem as quick to gamble huge budgets anymore. Streaming has also changed how everything works. So what’s next? Do mid-budget thrillers come back?

I know some people see it the opposite way, like keeping their memory and legacy alive, and I get that too. But for me it’s more unsettling than nostalgic.

It feels strange watching a movie knowing the actor who created that performance is no longer alive. Here I am being entertained by their work, yet the person themselves is gone forever. Their art lives on, but they themselves no longer exist. And in that moment, it doesn’t just make me think about them, it makes me confront my own mortality too.

1njue7e,Jaws: 50th Anniversary IMAX vs Jaws IMAX 2022,8,0.67,6,1758156401.0,True,"Is there a difference between the two releases? I remember the 2022 showing was touted as important because it was the first time Jaws was mastered to fit an IMAX aspect ratio.

I personally found the 2022 experience amazing and changed my perspective on viewing it on regular theaters and even home media. 

Side note the theater I saw it on is showing recently upgraded their projector to laser. This seems to be the only reason for me to see it on IMAX again as I notice the laser projectors seem consistently brighter.

I was planning on seeing it but I noticed a lot of releases this week and I have a busy schedule.

Did they change anything between the two IMAX releases content wise?

>Kogonada neither wrote nor edited A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, and so we’re largely lacking in the sophistication department, or the soft musicality he’s been able to construct in his earlier films.

[AV Club - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.avclub.com/a-big-beautiful-journey-review) \- 'C+'

>Is *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* a piece of wannabe creativity with a yawning hollowness at its center, or an A-list romance with some welcome aesthetic sensitivity? Like the outcome of a first date, it will ultimately be determined by chemistry.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-margot-robbie-and-colin-farrell-play-the-game-of-love) \- 3 / 5

>This film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well … or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge’s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no. The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.

[Variety - Tomris Laffly](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-1236520085/)

>The film’s tonal inconsistencies hurt its impossibly talented co-leads considerably. Most of the time, both Farrell and Robbie seem detached and surprisingly cold when they are supposed to be embracing intimate, vulnerable feelings audiences know they’re more than capable of projecting.

[IndieWire - Ryan Lattanzio](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-review-kogonada-1235151392/) \- 'D+'

>“A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is miscalculated as a romance and a fantasy, and while I’m loath to blame a craftsman as intelligent as Kogonada entirely for the outcome, he did, after all, agree to direct this lousy script. A big, bold, beautiful bore indeed.",movies
1njrrp9,Other movies like LOOKING FOR MR GOODBAR that do not prepare you for where it is going?,0,0.5,18,1758149262.0,True,"SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE, if you haven't seen it definitely check it out first! 

Recently ordered this movie on 4K, as it has always stuck with me. I first heard about it from my mom who saw it when it came out, and always said it was one of the most shocking films she had ever seen. 

Even by today's standards, it still holds up and packs quite a punch. The entire movie is just following around Diane Keaton who is a school teacher by day, then frequents bars at night, taking random men back to her apartment and sleeping with them. It doesn't play like a thriller or horror, just a slice of life/character study. Then in the last five minutes the guy freaks out and brutally stabs her to death. The end! 

Nothing throughout the movie really hints that this is going to happen, despite it being risky behavior and based on a true story. It is genuinely chilling and makes my stomach drop every time. Making it one of the more disturbing movies I've ever seen. 

Are there other movies like this? That takes a wild turn in its final moments and just leaves you trying to process what it hit you with? 

The only other one I can think of is Fat Girl, which also ends on a crazy last scene that left me totally disturbed. I'm also not just talking about movies with disturbing or insane second halves, but ones that aren't like that at all until the very ending. ",movies

1njqv7t,Looking for an Eastern European sci-fi / cyborg movie (2000–2020),0,0.48,9,1758147010.0,True,"Hi all, I’m trying to track down a foreign sci-fi movie I saw a few years ago and I’ve had no luck so far. Perhaps I've got some of the details messed up as can't find anything...  Here’s what I remember:

Male protagonist who’s a cyborg or augmented human, lot of the film feels like it’s from his point of view.

Modern-day / present-day setting, not overly futuristic, minimal dialogue. Mostly foreign language with subtitles.

One key scene is a chase, either in a car park or on a rooftop. During the chase, one of the cyborg’s eyes gets damaged, and the film shows a really obvious split-screen to reflect the damaged eye.

The film felt Eastern European, Bulgarian might be close...

1nkd5tt,Movies that celebrate American values?,0,0.24,58,1758213247.0,True,"What movies can you think of that depict traditional American values succeeding?

Not interested in jingoism, or larger-than-life heroes, or anything having to do with war. More interested in good outcomes from everyday Americans embodying the best of our nation.

One example is the technicians and bureaucrats in _Apollo 13_ exhibiting grit and competence in dealing with a looming disaster. Another is the jury in _12 Angry Men_ pushing through a fractious debate to achieve consensus. A third is Guy Pearce's willingness to demolish the corrupt edifice of his own success in the name of truth and justice, in _L.A. Confidential._

What others have you got for me?

**Edit:** Clearly I should have added that the values I'm talking about are not exclusively American ones, nor has America always lived up to them. But they are part of an optimistic story Americans used to tell ourselves about ourselves, in part through movies such as these.

Please let's not have a debate about that and focus instead on the examples I gave and what you can extrapolate from those.",movies

I mean, I saw BANDIT QUEEN and it was a non stop array of gang rapes and violence towards women but, oh no, it was really a film against abuse towards women while still exploiting it by almost being a fictional snuff movie. 

In Lorenzo's Oil, you spend most of the movie seeing a little boy screaming and suffering for help, it is an unbearable movie to go through. And I get that the idea is to move audiences by showing the effects of the disease but you already get that by showing less but making the message clear. Instead we get almost a hour and a half of a boy having painful surgeries and crying anf screaming. I almost quit watching the movie for this. I hate this kind of filmmaking. It's gratuitous and exploitative. 

Thank god for Susan Sarandon who gives a noble and graceful performance as Michaela Odone. As for Nick Nolte, they should have cast a Italian actor instead of Nolte using every Italian stereotype known to man. That accent was ridiculous. And I'm Italian.",movies

Here’s a taste of what we tackled on **Superman**:

We collaborated closely with director James Gunn and VFX Supervisor Stéphane Ceretti to reimagine Superman’s world, not just with spectacle, but with nuance, heart, and technical innovation.

\-Krypto the Superdog. Inspired by James Gunn’s dog Ozu, we captured every subtle gesture, emotion, and furry leap to ensure Krypto felt like a genuine canine first, only one who happened to have superpowers.

\-The Fortress of Solitude: We designed the Fortress using more than 6000 reflective crystals, each one a challenge in shading, lighting, and rendering.

\-4D Gaussian Splatting: A first in feature film, we used 4D Gaussian Splat to create Superman’s Kryptionian parents hologram.

\-And also the Engineer’s nanite power suit, SupermanRobots, Lex vs Krypto fight scene and more! You can learn about our work here: [https://www.framestore.com/work/superman](https://www.framestore.com/work/superman)

1nicwb9,"I disagree with the ""Pile of Stuff"" scene from Devil Wears Prada.",494,0.72,208,1758015466.0,True,"I don't want this to come across as some curmudgeonly rant against the fashion industry. I realise fashion is an art form like any other, and a lot of talented people work in the field.

However, there's one scene from the Devil Wears Prada that I never resonated with as much as others seemed to. It's the moment where Andy and Miranda are standing before a pile of clothes and Andy essentially claims that she isn't entrenched in the high fashion world, choosing instead to buy simple clothes from department stores.

What follows is a monologue from Miranda, essentially explaining that Andy is actually deeply affected by the decisions made by high level fashion designers which then trickle down into the department stores and bargain bins.

It always feels like the scene is supposed to prove Andy wrong. It certainly ends with Andy unable to reply, and the sense of a point scored in Miranda's favor.

But after all these years, I still don't feel the monologue really disproves Andy's point.

Yes her sweater is cerulean due to a trickle down of higher level design choices, but it's clear Andy still makes the decision to pick whatever item of clothing is available in the department store.

If an entire industry is based around promoting Style A, or Style B or Style C, yet it becomes apparent that Andy would pick whatever style is available, it actually paints her as immune to the fashion industry rather than beholden to it.

If they'd chosen green, she would have picked green.

It's like someone wanted to buy a watch just to tell the time. Yes I'm sure a million decisions are being made about watch faces and minute hands by incredibly passionate people... but if someone goes out and simply buys a watch, while they might be swayed in their choice by individual designs, they're hardly beholden to those higher decisions.

Miranda's argument seems to be ""a lot of people put a lot of work into this arbitrary decision you made"". But the scale of effort that goes into something doesn't seem convincing on its own; I think Andy would have been right to counter that, just because a lot of people worked on something, doesn't mean the work is inherently valuable to her decision.

Though I'm sure both things are true, and I have to commend The Devil Wears Prada for giving such food for thought after so many years.",movies

And how does this happen?,1,0.51,43,1758129430.0,True,"Maybe a loaded question here, but I had the opportunity to go see Boogie Nights in 70mm at the Plaza Theatre in Atlanta last night. This was my first experience seeing a movie projected on film (to my knowledge at least, definitely my first 70mm film showing). 

About midway through the movie it seemed as though the film got tangled or jumbled up in the reel and the movie had to be stopped for about 30 minutes for them to fix. After getting up and running again, an hour or so later, the screen went black then cut back only to show the film bubbling up and looking as though it had been burned out. At this point, the show was over and we couldn’t finish the movie. 

I’ve looked online to find this first question and haven’t found anything. But what happens when a theatre damages a film reel, especially one from an older film like Boogie Nights? 

Finally, how do these issues that popped up last night happen? I know there’s a lot that goes into the projection work, and maybe it’s a number of things. Just curious to hear from those more educated than me on this topic.

We could only confidently land on Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, and Jim Carrey. 

Our parameters have been narrowed down after a bit and are kinda specific for this:

1- Famous/active in our lifetime (born 1993&1995). I guess a pretentious ""defined my generation"" or ""popular"" thing (?)
2- Add  only a bit for recency bias
3- TV doesn't really count
4- Range does (some consideration for dramatic roles)
5- So does longevity and consistency 
6- not an actor that can be funny, it's someone that is comedy driven

Number 4? F in chat. 

John C Reilly maybe is too supporting character in my head (although I love everything he does). Jack Black? Eddie Murphy would be a great pick but idk, I'm a movie guy so I've seen a lot of older things later in life that skews my perception. Steve Carell doesn't lead a lot of movies, and my favorite stuff comes from his dramatic projects.

SO said Ben Stiller or Kevin Hart, I said Chris Rock, Seth Rogen, then Jonah Hill. ""If you say Jonah Hill I say Mr. Bean!"" Owen Wilson? ""Wes Anderson movies dont count"" ""Okay, f*** Martin Lawrence, Danny McBride, or Chris Tucker??"" "" NAME A MARTIN LAWRENCE MOVIE"" ""TINA FEY"" "" TIM ALLEN"" ""get fucked if you think hes as good as Carrey""

In this month's review we're at 1964, often considered the Year of the Musicals, where the winner was the elocution-and-diction-based classic, My Fair Lady.

In part 2, we see a very heated competition with other grand musicals, Mary Poppins and (to a lesser extent) A Hard Day's Night and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as well as some musing on Walt Disney's legacy in the Hollywood New Wave. Also discussed are the blockbuster Bond films, the first two Pink Panther films, the Cold War satire classic Dr. Strangelove, the rise of the counterculture with exploitation films and the first ever movie to be based on a TV show (and if you can actually guess which TV show that was without looking it up, I will personally high-five you).

1njct4c,When do CGI animals actually work better than the real thing? Scenes that convinced you (or didn't),0,0.47,50,1758114787.0,True,"Seeing the recent VFX folks chat about bringing a super-dog to life got me thinking about how often films swap real animals for digital ones, and when it actually helps the film vs. when it kind of kills the moment.

A few examples that come to mind for me:

* Life of Pi: Richard Parker was mostly CG, and yet I totally bought him. The weight, the eyes, the water interaction, it all felt terrifyingly real.
* The Call of the Wild: talented team, but the dog crossed into cartoony for me. I could never forget I was looking at a digital performance.
* Togo: really nice blend of practical dogs and VFX extensions. The dangerous shots felt safe but still tactile.
* Paddington: obviously CG, but he interacts with the world so cleanly that it sells. Totally different goal than photoreal, and it works.
* The Lion King (2019): uncanny valley for me emotionally. Incredible fur/lighting, but the faces felt locked down in a way that the original animation never did.

Where do you think CG animals shine? My gut says:

* When safety/danger is a factor (bear maulings, stampedes, etc.)
* When impossible behaviour is needed (talking, superpowers, crazy stunts)
* When the animal must hit exact story beats on cue, over and over

And where do they fall flat? For me it's often close-ups with subtle emotion, or when the physics feel a hair off. The tiniest mismatch in eye focus or paw weight and my brain checks out.

Curious what scenes fooled you completely. Any shots you swore were practical that turned out to be CG (or vice versa)? Trainers and VFX folks, would love your take. Also, with that new Anaconda project brewing, do you think a modern blend of animatronics + CG could beat the original? Or are we past the point where the rubber snake charm works at all?

1njii3i,Revisiting Inglorious Basterds (2009),0,0.35,9,1758127829.0,True,"Previously I had only seen this movie once, when it released in theaters. I remember having a pretty middling opinion of it, but that was decades ago so I wanted to revisit it. My opinions often change and I frequently find things to enjoy that maybe I didn't see the first time around. So I gave Inglorious Basterds a rewatch.

It's a decent movie, but my opinion of it remains unchanged. It's pretty middling as far as Tarantino films go, and dare I say overrated. When I say overrated I don't mean it's a bad film (it's not), just that it fails to live up to its own mythos.

Christopher Waltz's performance as Hans Landa is absolutely phenomenal and carries the whole movie. Waltz chews up the scenery every time he's on stage. Hans Landa alone makes the movie worth watching. This is both a boon and a curse, however, as his is really the only character that gets sufficient screentime to... *be* a character. None of the other actors/characters get enough time to be realized or fleshed out, we just see them in a couple short vignettes. Not even Shosanna gets a good chance at character establishment on-screen; it's all implied between shots. It's kinda wild that a film with such long runtime only truly establishes one of its characters, suggesting that perhaps the ensemble cast was just too big.

Within the context of fairly flat, one-dimensional characters, all of the other actors perform their craft capably. Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender do great with what they're given, they're just not given much. Their characters don't necessarily need to be deep, because they are sufficiently *fun*. Melanie Laurent brims with carefully constrained rage, and she deftly sells a character that wants to burn it all down.

The first 20 minutes of the film are fantastically tense, the final 20 minutes of the film are joyously cathartic, but for me everything in between becomes a bit of a slog.

My biggest problem is the plot structure. If we are to consider Shosanna's initial escape and subsequent revenge as the main plot line, then almost nothing in the movie is relevant to this. Virtually everything in furtherance of this plot happens offscreen, and the parts that we see on-screen have nothing to do with any of the other characters. Neither Fassbender nor Pitt do anything to further Shosanna's revenge plot; everything they do is completely incidental.

Tarantino has a style of storytelling that frequently begins with a wide cast of characters and sub-plots. As we view the events of the story through different perspectives, their plots become increasingly wound together until the end where it's one tight knot and the audience can see how they're all caught up in the same series of events and there aren't really sub-plots at all. Great examples of this can be found in *Pulp Fiction* or *Reservoir Dogs* or *The Hateful Eight*. I did not get this satisfaction from *Inglorious Basterds*; at the end of the film all the tangential plotlines remain completely tangential. They're not tightly woven into the fabric of Shosanna's plot, they just happen to exist somewhere alongside it.

My other gripe is that the Nazis aren't even really established as 'bad guys' in the film. I know that's weird to say because they're Nazis, but in a story you still have to establish what makes the bad guys 'bad.' Outside of the opening scene, which is admittedly amazing, we don't really see the Nazis doing Nazi stuff. I believe that's intentional because there's some very clear commentary here about people (like Nazis) believing they deserve the banality of a normal social life while doing some of the worst things imaginable, and how maybe we ought to disabuse them of that notion. Maybe if you're committing atrocities, we shouldn't let you just have lunch at a cafe and pretend like everything is normal.

But outside of the real-life knowledge you bring with you into the film, *Inglorious Basterds* doesn't spend any time establishing why the bad guys are the bad guys, or what it is that they do that makes them bad. There are a lot of different angles you could take with Nazis. There are dozens of messages or themes or lessons or ""points"" that could be plumbed there, but *Inglorious Basterds* eschews them all. These people are bad because we know and accept that they're bad as part of the premise, those people are good because we know and accept they're good as part of the premise. There's never really an actual indictment of the Nazi Party or fascism or authoritarianism in the film, from which a lesson or message could be derived.

Nazi Germany and WWII is an incredibly heavy and rich well of material that basically goes ignored throughout the film. Hans Landa and the Nazis don't need to be Nazis for the story to work exactly the same, Shosanna doesn't need to be Jewish for the story to work exactly the same. You could plug any generic protagonists/antagonists into the film and it would play out exactly the same. Shosanna could be a gambling addict and Landa could be a bookie and it could be set in L.A., it wouldn't change the story. They're just doing menacing bad-guy stuff, not Nazi stuff.

All of this culminates to leave the middle of the film feeling incredibly hollow and shallow. It really feels like the bulk of the film is just Tarantino reveling in hyperviolence and a feeling of righteous indignance. It feels like the Nazi setting was chosen for the sole reason that you can display extreme violence against Nazis (or zombies) in film without your audience feeling obligated to ask moralistic questions.",movies

1njow2x,LAW ABIDING CITIZEN 2 WITH JAMIE FOXX AND GERARD BUTLER,0,0.12,10,1758142217.0,True,"I just rewatched the original Law Abiding Citizen (Law Abiding Citizen 1), and I think it's time for a sequel where we find out that Gerard Butler survived the events of the first film. I know as impressionable children we were all burned by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze, when it turned out that Shredder survived being crushed in a trash compactor, but hear me out. 

If Law Abiding Citizen 2 started with Gerard Butler surviving it would actually retroactively improve the first film. Gerard Butler is a master tactician who is always 2 steps ahead, but then Jamie Foxx literally just walks in his back door and catches him flat-footed? That's too convenient. It also never made sense thematically for Jamie Foxx's character to go from being a cynical tool of the system with blood on his hands to the victorious good guy just by assassinating a prisoner in his cell. Fuck right off with that nonsense. Either they both die or they both survive to fight another day. 

Give me 1 scene where Butler pulls out a handcuff key and then ducks into a bomb shelter he had previously built below his prison cell's bunk. Fast forward 20 years and he's been living in hiding like Hannibal Lecter and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), and the whole time he has been following Jamie Foxx's career. Foxx ends up in the news when some case he is involved in ends in a bad way, and another family killer goes free. Butler comes out of hiding to bring the justice system down on Foxx's head again, and this time he's had 20 years to plan out his Rube Goldberg bullshit. 

Bonus points: 20 years in seclusion mourning his family has fucked him up so bad he's basically turned into Big Nick from Den of Thieves 1 and Den of Thieves 2. I mean come on who wouldn't watch that movie.

Tracy, wife of Andy, and lover of Jed, was equally culpable and villainous if not more! Jed was a fraud, cheater and a manipulative person but never a killer. Heck! His thought never ventured into the territory of killing someone no how narcissistic and egotistical maniac he may be. 

Tracy, on the hand, was equally manipulative, but to top it, she was a psychopath who could do anything to get her objective: be it cheating, getting pregnant, getting abortion to gain sympathy, even killing someone - even a child.

1njkiys,Red Dawn (1984) is the dumbest piece of american propaganda I've ever watched,0,0.33,58,1758132218.0,True,"Like, it's genuinely hilarious how blatantly hypocritical and illogical the message is, bordering on facist imagery.

- I always knew that the worst danger for world peace was the german greens party.
- The movie starts with such a bad history lesson I'd mistake it for making fun of americans being uneducated in a different movie
- the only black guy of course dies immediatly 
- the communists somehow land with paratroopers despite lacking air superiority, and immediatly start killing random people, as one does during an invasion, because fuck actually conquering anything, we're here to fire RPGs at school busses
- the american helicopter displays the impressive strategy of shooting rockets at the also american town hall
- the kids are so american they somehow manage to bring enough bullets for an army, but not any water
- despite no native americans actually appearing in the movie, the protagonists still manage to be casually racist against them
- the communists are ultra-controlling and oppressive, but that never actually stops the protagonists from going anywhere and talking to anybody (because the enemy has to be strong and weak at once)
- the communists locking people in camps without trial is a source of horror (because americans would never profile people and lock them into camps)
- the protagonists commit a war crime, make up an excuse, and it never gets brought up again (realistic americans) - by the way, they've never heard of the geneva convention (this has to be a parody, right?)
- US officer confuses ""great britain"" and ""england"" despite great britain being one of their only allies in WW3
- 400 million dead chinese is the punchline for a joke, because nobody cares about dead chinese 
- you'd think that sexually harassing girls would be another thing supposed to make me hate the communists, but no, the americans also do that
- despite obviously having a lot of aircraft, the communists only once (at the very end) actually use them against the protagonists, because otherwise it would be over after half an hour
- i could *maybe* care about the half-hearted anti-war messages if the writer hadn't written the whole script one-handed because he was so busy jerking it to the idea of dead russians
- tanks *never* have infantry support, because the soviets got their doctrine from a box of cereal
- protagonists get upset about the russians torturing prisoners in **the same scene** where they torture a prisoner themselves
- american girl utterly *sieved* by a helicopter-mounted MG somehow requires a mercy kill because her nigh-unlimited hitpoints do not allow her to die to anything below grenades
- protagonist gets shot because he desperately had to drop a one-liner before killing the antagonist
- communist is the only person in the movie to ever spare somebody, because apparently even in their own fantasy americans can't concieve of showing mercy

Its insane how much this movie made me hate americans. The utter arrogance and ignorance required to create this movie. How did trash like this get an even worse sequel? I almost wish Hollywood had burned in the fires of cuban aggression, because that would have spared the world this abomination.

All in all 6/10 movie, at least if you've drunk five beers beforehand.",movies
1ni0kij,"September 12-14 Box Office Recap – 'Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle' opens with an incredible $70M domestically, the biggest debut for an anime. Worldwide, the film crosses $450M. 'Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale' and 'Long Walk' open solidly, while 'Spinal Tap II' flops in ninth place.",73,0.78,27,1757976146.0,True,"https://preview.redd.it/qz0rpc64pepf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78a538f0dded5ea9be496979987b929230cc72c

It was another incredible week in September, as ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** destroyed so many records in its domestic debut, as well as new overseas territories. The rest of the newcomers had varying degrees of performance: ***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** and ***The Long Walk*** had solid debuts, and ***Spinal Tap II: The End Continues*** unsurprisingly flopped in wide release.

The Top 10 earned a combined $139.3 million this weekend. That's up a massive 61.9% from last year, when ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice*** repeated at #1.

Debuting at #1, ***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** earned an incredible $70.6 million in 3,315 theaters. That's not only the biggest in the franchise, but it's also the biggest debut for an anime film domestically, dethroning ***Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back*** ($31 million) after 26 years. It's also the sixth biggest September debut in history, and the biggest animated debut of the year.

How could ***Demon Slayer*** open this high? It's one thing to break ***Pokémon***'s record, but to make twice as much is just nonsensical. Simply put, the popularity of the anime and manga have increased drastically over the past years (it's reported to have sold 220 million copies). But the main selling point was that this is the beginning of the end: it's the first part of a planned trilogy. So it's practically getting all possible fans for the final ride.

Sony didn't spend much on marketing: Deadline reported marketing was just $10-$12 million, and that didn't include linear or sports spend. Instead, Sony heavily targeted promo on Crunchyroll, which was a smart strategy. Some properties just prove to have a more loyal audience, who is ready to pay tickets for a film.

According to Sony, 57% of the audience was male and 71% was in the 18-34 demographic. Its biggest demographic was Hispanics, which represented 37% of the audience. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, which fits well with its positive reviews. The film is just $15 million away from passing ***Pokémon*** to become the biggest anime title in North America. It also really makes you think how big the next two films will be, whenever they come out.

And don't expect great legs for this. Anime titles have been notorious for their front-loaded nature, and with a huge debut, ***Demon Slayer*** is going to take a steep drop next week. It's also seen in its opening weekend, for walk-ups were very weak: walk-ups represented only 33% of the weekend's audience. For a comparison, the average walk-ups for an MCU title usually is 50% or 60%, and family titles are 75%. So clearly, the film won't have much appeal outside its fanbase. But when there's numbers like this, it's hard to be disappointed.

In second place, ***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** earned $25.6 million. That's a gigantic 69.5% drop from last week, which is the steepest in the franchise; it was worse than ***The Nun*** (66.1%). The drop isn't entirely surprising, given the film's ""finale factor"" led to a gigantic opening and the film's mediocre reception, but it still fell harder than expected. Nevertheless, with $130.5 million in the bank, it doesn't really matter as it's already a big hit. It's just $7 million away from passing the original ***Conjuring*** for the highest grossing film in the franchise, but it doesn't look like $200 million will be reachable.

In third place, Focus Features' ***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** earned $18.1 million in 3,694 theaters. That's 13% above ***A New Era*** ($16 million), but it's still below the first film ($31.3 million). Not like there wasn't much to be expected here.

By this point, it's pretty much clear that this is for fans of the show only. It couldn't garner the big jump like other ""finale factor"" films, but it's probably unrealistic to expect it. At least the reviews (90% on RT) were strong enough to make sure that people knew this would be a satisfying closure to this franchise.

According to Focus Features, 72% of the audience was female. As expected, it skewed old; 56% of the audience was 55 and over. They gave it a strong ""A"" on CinemaScore, suggesting very word of mouth on its favor. Usually, films targeting old audiences enjoy good legs. So at the very least, ***Downton Abbey*** should make something around $50 million at worst.

In fourth place, Lionsgate's ***The Long Walk*** debuted with $11.7 million in 2,845 theaters. Compared to other Stephen King adaptations, that's below this year's ***The Monkey*** ($14 million) and 2023's ***The Boogeyman*** ($12.3 million). But those were more supernatural horror, compared to the dystopian thriller horror in ***The Long Walk***.

The budget was kept low at $20 million, so this a well enough debut. And it's complicated to ask for much better numbers for a film like this. For decades, attempts to adapt the novel have fizzled out, with Frank Darabont attached at one point. Unlike other mainstream horror films, this was very bleak, given that this revolves around teenagers forced to participate in a march, where they'll be killed if they stop. Reviews were quite strong (90% on RT), but some audience members probably preferred to skip it based on its content. It doesn't help that it opened on the second weekend of ***The Conjuring: Last Rites***, which was the main horror attraction this month.

According to Lionsgate, 61% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is fine for a horror, especially considering the film's brutal and bleak tone. Perhaps it could leg out, but ***The Conjuring*** is still the top horror title, and ***Him*** could surprise the following week. For now, ***The Long Walk*** should finish with around $30 million. Not bad for a film like this.

Disney re-released ***Toy Story*** for its 30th anniversary, and the film earned $3.4 million in 2,375 theaters. That took its lifetime total to $195.9 million.

***Weapons*** dropped 47.8% and added $2.7 million this weekend. The film has earned $147.4 million, and it should cross $150 million in the next few days.

After its strong debut, ***Hamilton*** collapsed 78.1%, earning 2.2 million. Through 10 days, the film has made $14.9 million.

In eighth place, ***Freakier Friday*** dropped 45.2%, for a $2.1 million weekend. That took its domestic total to $91.1 million, and it looks like it will finish below the $100 million milestone.

You have to go to ninth place to find another wide newcomer. Did you know there was a ***Spinal Tap*** sequel this weekend? You can't be blamed for missing it, as Bleecker Street often misses the mark when it comes to distributing films. And such was the case of ***Spinal Tap II: The End Continues***, which flopped with just $1.6 million in 1,920 theaters. On a $22 million budget, that's absolutely poor.

This debut is no surprise. Despite its status as one of the greatest comedies ever, ***This Is Spinal Tap*** is still a niche property. After all, the original film tapped out with just $4.4 million domestically. Even if we adjusted for inflation, that's just $14 million, which is far below other popular comedies at the time. Usually, when you make a sequel, you strike while the iron is hot, not 41 years later. Even the reviews were far from the original (a middling 67% on RT and 59 on Metacritic), so there was no appeal outside of big fans.

According to Bleecker Street, 74% of the audience was male. A huge problem for the sequel was the lack of interest from young audiences, and the stats reflect that: 60% of the audience was 45 and over. Basically, it's only aimed towards Gen X and older Millennials. In some good news, they gave it a good ""A–"" on CinemaScore, which is actually above the original's ""B"". Although the original was a brand new property that audiences weren't prepared for back in 1984. Nevertheless, with a very slow debut, it's gonna lose tons of screenings soon. It's very likely ***Spinal Tap II*** fails to outgross the original's unadjusted domestic gross.

Rounding out the Top 10 was another re-release: ***The Sound of Music***, which made $1.6 million in 1,219 theaters. That takes its lifetime gross to $164.8 million.

Just outside the Top 10, ***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** dropped 53% and added $1.5 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $272.4 million.

The Indian title ***Mirai*** managed to earn $1.2 million in 400 theaters. That's $1.6 million if we add its Thursday numbers.

***The Bad Guys 2*** dropped 52%, for a $1.1 million weekend. The film has earned $79.4 million, and it will close with around $83 million domestically.

***Caught Stealing*** is also leaving theaters very quickly, as it fell from fifth place all the way to #14. After its steep second weekend drop, the third weekend was even worse: 65%, and just $1.1 million. The film has earned $17.6 million, and it's gonna struggle to get to $20 million.

In limited release, Mubi's ***The History of Sound*** debuted with $82,143 in 4 theaters. That translates to a so-so $20,536 per-theater average.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle*** also opened in a lot of key markets overseen by Sony, and that led to a pretty great weekend. The film earned $61 million overseas, taking its worldwide debut to $132 million. Adding in its Asian markets, the film has already grossed a gigantic $450 million (according to Deadline, there's some higher estimates but they're still unconfirmed). The film had strong debuts in Mexico ($9.8M), India ($5.2M), the UK ($4.6M), Brazil ($4.4M), Spain ($3.7M), Australia ($3.2M), Italy ($3M), Saudi Arabia ($2.8M), Peru ($2.8M), Central America ($2.4M), Argentina ($2.2M), and Chile ($2.2M). By next week, the film will pass ***Mugen Train*** ($506 million) to become the biggest Japanese film in history.

***The Conjuring: Last Rites*** added $60.5 million overseas, which is quite solid considering the arrival of ***Demon Slayer***, allowing it to take its worldwide total to a fantastic $332 million. The best markets are Mexico ($21.2M), the UK ($16.6M), Brazil ($13.4M), India ($10.4M) and Germany ($10.3M). By next week, it'll become the first film in the franchise to cross $400 million worldwide.

***Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale*** opened with $12.6 million overseas, for a $30.4 million worldwide start. Obviously, its biggest market was the UK with $6.3 million, preventing ***Demon Slayer*** from taking the top spot. Other markets include France ($1.4M), Australia ($1.2M), Netherlands ($900K) and Italy ($500K). This is solid, considering these were just 31 markets. It will keep adding more in the next few weeks.

Two films hit milestones this weekend. ***Materialists***, which is still going strong in its international run, has passed $100 million worldwide. It's A24's third biggest film worldwide, just behind ***Everything Everywhere All At Once*** ($142 million) and ***Civil War*** ($127 million). Also this weekend, Paramount's ***The Naked Gun*** has finally crossed $100 million worldwide.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Elio* | Jun/20 | Disney | $20,840,667 | $72,987,454 | $154,075,778 | $150M
*Together* | Jul/30 | Neon | $6,763,357 | $21,273,159 | $32,273,159 | $17M
*Honey Don't!* | Aug/22 | Focus Features | $3,025,525 | $5,810,510 | $6,736,510 | $20M

- Very dark times for Pixar originals. ***Elio*** has ended its run with a very poor $72 million domestically and $154 million worldwide. In both fronts, it's an all-time low for Pixar. Factoring its $150 million budget, this is one of the year's biggest flops. Failing to attract families, this is some bad omen for the studio, at least on the original titles. You can see it in its future: 3 of the 5 scheduled titles are sequels. The big question now is what will be of ***Hoppers*** next year? Cause ***Elio*** showed there's no floor for a Pixar title.

- Neon's ***Together*** has closed with $21 million domestically and $32 million worldwide. A solid take for a body horror, but its $17 million budget doesn't paint the film as a success. Clearly there's a market for the genre, but there's clearly a ceilling on its potential.

- Turns out the title was a warning. Ethan Coen's ***Honey Don't!*** has closed with a terrible $5.8 million domestically and $6.7 million worldwide, against a $20 million budget. Somehow managed to make even less than ***Drive-Away Dolls***, but the film's very tepid response at Cannes killed all its prospects. Whatever the case, it's clear that Ethan's solo works aren't connecting with audiences.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

There's two newcomers, and only one will fight for the top spot.

Universal is releasing something we rarely see on films: a sports horror film. That's ***Him***, which follows the trials of a young up-and-coming football player training at the isolated compound of an aging, nearly retired quarterback. Produced by Jordan Peele, it stars Marlon Wayans, playing against type as the antagonistic quarterback. The premise and trailers look very intriguing, and those horror fans uninterested in ***The Conjuring*** could get interested in this. But will it be strong enough to take the #1 spot?

The other release is Sony's ***A Big Bold Beautiful Journey***, directed by Kogonada. A romantic fantasy film starring Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell. There aren't many options for couples, so this is a film that could be a main attraction for women. But the film has skipped festivals, and awareness seems quite low on this one. Sony spent $50 million in buying the film, so there's some high expectations that might not pan out.

Jimmy Hollywood was an interesting, dark comedy from Barry Levinson. I saw it in the theater and then when it came on VHS I was puzzled by the warning ""some footage has been added and some deleted from the theatrical version.""

Then there's Anora - which I was lukewarm on, but again I couldn't forget the film and someone's analysis about the working class being brought down to their own level in the end, not the fairytale ending (Igor and Ani).

Obviously this movie is terrible, the worst Mission: Impossible movie ever, and the only bad movie in the franchise, and it’s clearly badly directed by John Woo and somehow written by the Oscar winning writer of Chinatown which I do not believe at all as I think some other people messed with it and went uncredited, but these 2 are really bad in this movie, like laughably bad, no one else in the movie is as bad as these 2 are. Cruise isn’t great but he’s doing what he can. I’m really happy they stopped hiring this team to make MI movies because the acting in the rest of the movies is fantastic for the most part. Scott acts so badly and makes weird faces, Newton just rolls her eyes and screams a bit. Yawn. ",movies

This for me extends to the opening credits sequence in The Purge (2013), the Recent War of the Worlds movie, they used actual war, disaster and other images and CGI'd Aliens into them, even going so far as to recreate footage of an actual plane crash in Afghanistan on the Producer's insistence.

Something about using this kind of footage, to try and hone in on the severity of the scenario, just never sat right with me. This isn't just really vague footage that's just static or even stock footage, no this is actual footage of people being killed, bombed in a real war, and being victims of shootings in a for-profit film is just enraging.

Thank you for your awesome replies.

I’m curious to hear your choice. I’ll start: the first meeting between Anthony Hopkins’ Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster’s Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs is, to me, one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history. The writing is brilliant, of course, but the tension, menace, and vulnerability come almost entirely from the performances. At its core, it’s just an FBI trainee interviewing a prisoner—but Hopkins and Foster transform it into a masterclass in acting, making it unforgettable.

I thought about how I talk at least and how a few others I know talk in daily life. I'm an introvert and have trouble finding the right words. But maybe it's not really common for people who talk more?

I just don't witness enough authentic-sounding dialogue like this in movies.

Maybe a lot of dialogue is missing authenticity like this because actors are trained to remember and deliver clearly written lines. As an actor you want to do your best, say your lines perfectly. 

But it would add to the realism and add to the authentic feel that the viewer is hearing regular dialogue.

Or perhaps more succinct and easily delivered lines are ultimately better for the success of the movie in terms of audience comprehension and attention. Imperfect dialogue might break the flow of what the character is expressing and you might lose patience.

Anybody else have similar thoughts?

***Mod Reviews/Summaries:***

* **Hamnet**

>Based on a novel of the same name, Chloe Zhao directs what is surely to be the most emotionally devastating film of the year. Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare and Jessie Buckley as his wife Agnes star in this deeply hard-hitting film about grief and art. 

* **Eternity**

>Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, and Callum Turner star in this afterlife dramedy in which you have seven days to choose what kind of afterlife you would like for eternity once you die. Few are allowed to wait behind for their spouse or someone they love which is exactly what happens when geriatric couple Joan and Larry die within a week of each other and revert to their younger selves only to find Joan’s first husband who died in the war has been waiting for decades for her to come and spend eternity with him. 

* **Left-Handed Girl**

>Sean Baker collaborator and director Shih-Ching Tsou gives us this slice of life movie about a little girl in Taipei trying to stay out of trouble as her mother and older sister struggle to make ends meet. A very endearing look at daily life for this family.

* **The Secret Agent**

>Wagner Moura stars in this true story of espionage and politics in 1970s Brazil as he attempts to regain custody of his son. Not as punchy as it sounds, but a very thorough look at the times and complications of the time. 

* **Wake Up Dead Man**

>Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig are back with the third Knives Out film. This time darker than ever and with a cast of who’s whos trying to solve the crime of the murdered priest in a subversion of closed door mysteries. 

* **Frankenstein**

>A movie that feels like Guillermo has been shooting it in his head for Decades, Frankenstein sees Jacob Elordi as the monster and Oscar Isaac as the infamous doctor. WIth a supporting cast including Christoph Waltz and Mia Goth and some extremely Del Toro-esque set design and action, this movie feels like a true passion project.

* **Ballad of a Small Player**

>Directed  by Conclave’s Edward Berger, this is a feverish film of a career gambler played by Colin Farrell spiraling as he seems to be truly out of the means needed to continue his lavish and risky lifestyle. Stuck in Macau and with no friends to speak of he meets a Chinese woman who gives him an extension on his debts. 

* **The Smashing Machine**

>Electrically directed by Benny Safdie, The Smashing Machine is the true story of Mark Kerr, an extreme fighter who brought the sport to the mainstream. Dwayne Johnson is at times unrecognizable as he plays Mark like a gentle giant battling addiction and Emily Blunt plays his long-term girlfriend who can’t seem to help him the way he needs to be helped.

* **Blue Moon**

>Another 2025 biopic by Richard Linklater, Blue Moon sees Ethan Hawke as Lorenz Hart, the composer best known as Richard Rogers’ writing partner before he met Edward Hammerstein and redefined broadway showtunes. Taking place on the night Oklahoma! premieres and all in the famous Broadway bar Sardi’s, Ethan Hawke delivers 100 minutes of lavish dialogue as this bisexual short king and Margaret Qualley and Andrew Scott show up for supporting performances. You can feel Linklater overcome with joy to give this man the love he never got in his time. 

* **Winter of the Crow**

>A political thriller starring Lesley Manville that gets at one of the true fears in life. Visiting a country during a coup and losing your passport. Manville plays a psychiatry professor who is invited to Warsaw in the 1960’s to give a lecture. When she arrives she quickly finds that Warsaw is no London and as a military coup takes place overnight she will have to learn the rules and adapt quickly in order to escape.

* **Carolina Caroline**

>Samara Weaving and Kyle Gallner star in this Southern Bonnie & Clyde about a passionate love affair tied up in grifting and robbing banks that covers most of the South. It’s a hot crime spree full of goodbyes and gunshots and Samara really holds it together.

* **The Wizard of the Kremlin**

>Directed by French director Oliver Assayas, this is a fictional account of the history of Russian politics from the 90s to today including the rise of Putin and the importance of using the internet as a battle ground. Paul Dano plays a young idealist playwright who becomes seduced by power and ends up using his talents of understanding the people and the politics to forward Russian control. Once Putin takes power, played by Jude Law, he becomes the advisor behind the throne for one of the most powerful and ambitious governments in the world. 

***Community Reviews:***

*  Under the Same Sun 5/5 - wow. the visuals of this one were incredible. It's the most floored I've been by cinematography since last year's 'Perfumed with Mint'. Best color palette I've seen in a long time. the depth of each character was off the charts, and the main character's insecurities and power struggles were so well portrayed. It was a great representation of the opportunism of Europeans profiting off of the colonial system. Great performances from all the leads. It was so lush i felt like I could have watched another hour of this. My favorite film this year aside from Hamnet. The Q&A was great too. Perfect way to end my tiff trip - u/TyQuanDean
* Frankenstein 3.5/5 I unfortunately did have high expectations for this movie, it was the only movie I really wanted to see in the beginning. I thought the cinematics were wonderful, but I echo the sentiment that Part 1 was too long. I understand the build up was needed but I feel like there could have been a better way to transition into Part 2 and make P2 even more impactful. I'm also conflicted with how the movie ended. - u/cyberslowpoke
* Driver's Ed: 2/5. This was a dud for me, and the script had me cringing more than laughing. Maybe I'm just dead inside? - u/Rubiam98
* New Year's Rev: 4/5⭐️ It was funny, it was touching, and soooo much fun!!! I thought it perfectly captured what it feels like to be a teenager, where every emotion is dialed to 11 and anything seems possible :) - u/evil-poatotes
* Sirat - 3⭐ Honestly, I'm shocked this isn't getting more mixed reviews (other than from Spanish Letterboxd users). A devastating dystopian tale of finding a path forwards amid grief and strife. Technical-wise, a masterclass in tension and sound mixing. Mostly, though, I was just waiting for it to end. I cannot think of a single person in my life who would benefit from watching this film. - u/cleric_of_deneir
* Rental Family - A very cozy and heartwarming movie. Emotionally manipulative, sure, but the stellar cast and excellent cinematography unite to help communicate the emotion very well, with also a great score too. I guess it was a tad predictable but I felt the other elements that were so well done helped drown that out. Really amazing visually too, and there's some shots that, even watching the trailer, I'm thinking ""oh yeah!"". Brendan Fraser is always fun to watch and he really impressed here. So glad our himbo king (and a true inspiration to me) is getting work nowadays. 8/10. - u/PapaAsmodeus
* California Schemin’ pretty entertaining movie about 2 Scottish rappers who pretended to be American to achieve fame. A true story too. Downside is that it gets repetitive. 6/10 - u/veggie_burgher
* Little Sister: 5/5. A quietly powerful coming-of-age story about a young Muslim woman navigating faith, family, and sexuality. Nadia Melliti’s performance floored me. So much is said with so little. - u/saudiguy
* She Has No Name - 5/5 for me. Great acting, very immersive, good pacing, beautiful cinematography. It takes place at the end of the Japanese occupation so it’s an interesting time to explore  - u/AssumptionFit5846
* If I Had Legs, I’d Kick You was a 4/5 for me. Rose Byrne’s performance is one of the best of the year for SURE and the whole vibe of the screening was so fun. Such a ride. - u/rusicaltheater
* The Lost Bus - 7.5. Man this has some pretty intense moments! A few times the shaky cam was a bit much but I felt very engrossed in the action. Seems like a crowd pleaser. Could definitely do a theatrical run. Was sat next to a guy from California who used to be a bus driver and whose mother lived close to the area when this fire happened. - u/mistakes_were_made24
* Wizard of Kremlin - 2/10, its biggest sin being insanely long and boring. Also “humour” was flat and the whole movie felt lazy. Unlike something like Chernobyl, where the movie had a lot of respect and attention to the events it was showing, this movie was more preoccupied with beating your over the head with its political message rather then trying to tell you a story. People coming out of cinema seemed exhausted - never seen the crowd being so drained. - u/vitoos
* Dust Bunny: I really liked this one! Someone said that if you liked Sketch last year that you'll like this, and I completely agree. It got a lot of laughs in my screening and I found Sophie Sloan extremely charming. I loved the colour palette (Wes Anderson for kids?) and I will take Aurora's entire wardrobe in adult sizes thx - u/Math_Chips
* Exit 8 - 3.5/5: perfectly fine horror film, cool to see a mainstream Japanese film play, probably would have been better at midnight madness, and enjoyed it quite a bit. - u/pgvildys
* Hamnet 5+/5 - overwhelming beautiful, every frame was put to perfect use. Incredible performances, cinematography, score. Showed a whole range of life's most critical moments with urgency and tenderness, filled with joy and devastation alike. One of the best films I've seen in a long time - u/TyQuanDean
* Kokuho - 3/5 stars. You really feel the runtime on this one. It needed an intermission. It felt more like an extended showcase of Kabuki with a thin story propping it up, rather than a suitable mixture of each. Having seen a Kabuki play (once), it seemed faithful to the art - u/GKJ5
* Hedda- 3.5/5. Wanted to understand the main character’s motivations a bit more but interesting story and liked the cinematography. - u/analastrassi
* Couture: 4.5/5 - The only film this TIFF that made me cry (I couldn’t get tickets for Hamnet). Angelina Jolie gives her most internalized performance in a long time and she amazes and dazzles and touches your heartstrings. In a just world, she would be getting raves and be an awards contender. - u/apple_2050
* She Has No Name - 8/10. Crime thriller that had me engaged from beginning to end. I also loved the feminist themes in it... - u/SetsunaTales80
* Easy’s Waltz - very meh movie. Pacing is odd and it felt like there was no plot or development. It’s just an all vibes movie. Probably direct to streaming for Prime or HBO Max. It shoulda showed more / doubled down on the darker themes to add tension. - u/AJ_Loft
* Fuck My Son!: 1/5 but also 5/5 for the vibe. This movie should ONLY be seen with a Midnight Madness crowd. - u/LionelEssrog
* Testament of Ann Lee: Messy, ambitious and crazed, Testament is another big swing from Fastvold and Corbet. This time, it wasn't nearly as effective for me, but superb crafts, great performances and resplendent musical numbers still ensured I had a pretty good time with this. Praise be! - u/DeoGame
* Obsession 4/5: This years standout “pure” horror movie, much like The Substance before it. Saw it at 6pm but was still incredibly effective at the tension and scares. Excellent acting and great comedic bits too. Incredible debut from Curry Baker. - u/BreadfruitWorth
* Highly recommend THE PRESIDENT'S CAKE. Filmed in Iraq, will be Iraq's Oscar submission, non-actors, and talking about a period of history (early 90s) that hasn't been presented in movies before. Very touching. - u/successfulbagel
* Fuck my son - 2/10. Easily the worst thing i ve seen at tiff in the last few years. Fever dream that overstays its welcome 20 minutes in. - u/John_Dobski
* Two Pianos: only the first hour was good because Charlotte Rampling is, of course, glorious. But the last half of the film was such a drag because the two remaining leads are chaotic and annoying and not in a fun way. I hate it passionately and considered it a waste of time (at least the second half of the movie was). - u/AlwaysStranger2046
* My Father’s Shadow is excellent! A simple, yet poignant story but it is beautifully performed and directed. I love how Lagos is a character in the story in itself. So so good! - u/reagege18",movies

1nin56d,Every argument against sex scenes in cinema is just people trying to rationalise their own ingrained puritanism and discomfort with open sexuality,0,0.39,60,1758042059.0,True,"I'm not talking about *specific* sex scenes, obviously, because there are some bad ones out there. I'm talking about sex scenes as a concept. Sex scenes are *good*. Even ""unnecessary"" sex scenes. Look...

**""Sex scenes and nudity aren't necessary to show intimacy""**

This one gets used a lot. ""These characters can just kiss! You can show they're in a relationship by having them go shopping together! They can just sleep in the same bed!""

I mean, you *can* do all that, but there are specific kinds of intimacy that are best expressed (or can even only be expressed) through nudity and sex scenes. In A History of Violence, Tom and Edie's initial sex scene is almost quaint; later, as the horror of his past seeps into their domesticity, the second sex scene springs from a domestic incident, and is actively violent.

Even outside of sex scenes, showing nudity can tell you a lot about a relationship or world. A married couple may walk around the house casually naked together, because they are so used to one another. Or in Robocop and Starship Troopers men and women get changed in the same locker room, to indicate that in these possible futures, gender simply isn't paid attention to within these militaristic groups.

And even if you can think of a way to express this without anyone taking off their clothes - why bother? What is inherently wrong about nudity or sexuality that it shouldn't be used as a narrative tool the same as every single other element of human existence?

It's a *you* problem, not a sex problem.

**""If I want to jack off, I can watch porn""**

This is one of the more depressing arguments. You don't *have* to masturbate whenever you feel aroused, you can enjoy the feeling without bringing it to a messy conclusion. What are you, a *chimp*?

It also suggests a very compartmentalised, utilitarian view of sex, in which we put sex in its little dirty shame box until we're in a dark room apart from the rest of our lives, then we take it out only to cum, and then - back in the box.

It's weird. Sexuality is a part of most people, and a part of their lives. You can feel horny without acting on it - I hope - and you don't have to live in absolute denial that you have functional genitals.

**""If there's a sex scene in a movie, I can't watch it in a group""**

That's a you problem and a group problem, not a sex scene problem.

**""Sex and nudity in film are inherently exploitative""**

No they're not. Yes, absolutely atrocious shit has happened in Hollywood (and I'm sure in Bollywood and other major film hubs), but that stuff happens irrespective of what's happening in front of the cameras. People have been coerced into sex acts to get *non-sexual* parts in films. People are assaulted just because their attackers can do so, without even the promise of a role.

Of course, nobody should be made to perform a role they don't feel comfortable with, and intimacy coordinators and other kinds of safeguards should be in place.

But don't assume that just because you are uncomfortable with nudity and sexuality, everyone else is too. Emma Stone is an Oscar-winner who can do pretty much whatever she wants, and she *produced* Poor Things. The idea that any woman appearing on screen in a sexual situation is a victim is absurd.

**""Gratuitous sex, nudity and titillation are unnecessary and bad""**

Counterpoint: no they're not, you're just uncomfortable with them. Looking at attractive people being nude is *nice* and *fun.* Watching them simulate sex is even more so. Attractive people can be enjoyed aesthetically so long as they're consenting and there's nothing wrong with that. Look at Desperado - Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek are the two sexiest people on the planet. Watching them naked together is *really, really great* for almost anyone who's into women or men or both

We are culturally fine with gratuitous violence; we have no problem watching Thanos kill half the population of the universe, or Ultron raze a city with his robot minions. Is it necessary for billions of people to die to gird a superhero into action? No. But the spectacle and the shock work on a visceral level that is pleasurable. Watching John Wick balletically flip, twist and somersault his way through mass murder is *cool as fuck*. Nobody's saying ""Well, you could just imply that John killed all those people off camera, why do we have to see it?""

And yet, experiencing a similar visceral thrill through an erotic thriller like Basic Instinct or Disclosure or even just a single brief sex scene is frowned upon. Even though consensual sex is a popular and accepted thing, and mass murder is not.

There's simply nothing inherently wrong with having people be naked or simulating sex on camera for the audience's enjoyment, any more than there's something wrong with a fun action scene or a beautiful establishing shot or unnecessary but spectacular camerawork. Footage enjoyed as sheer sensation and can contribute to the overall enjoyment of the piece; a film should not be just a checklist of ""necessary developments"" that are checked off with industrial precision.

So why object to to it?

If you're not asexual, it's just because you have weird sexual hang-ups drilled into you. That's all.",movies

1nib3ap,Found a movie script for American Gangster,0,0.31,2,1758008378.0,True,"Went looking for 1 and found it pretty easily, because I was trying to find out if there were any consequences for Nicky Barnes cutting the product without Frank's approval. Ironically, I do not see any punishment, but at least in the movie script he is more or less warned by Frank, in a context of not receiving any kind words (as it implies in the script he is waiting for a friendly response, but doesn't get it).

In the movie itself it's portrayed more or less as somehow Nicky pressures Frank to succumb to pressure and responding: ""My man"" in Denzel type of way as he walks out of the club.

Then in the script Frank is talking to Teddy and tells him not to come over the club anymore, which could imply that he will no longer conduct sales in that club to Nicky. But, in the movie this aspect is missing, and it's left up to imagination, but almost as though there is no punishment to Nicky.  
Also, in the script there is no tossing glass off the table by Nicky, which seemed like an odd ""power move"" in front of a person that pops people before he eats lunch (like with Tango). 

By the way Nicky Barnes is Jackie Fox in the script. 

A lot of these details seem to be rather important in how Frank conducted business, not to glamorize drug dealers in real life, but at least it's far more believable. 

I watched this movie dozens of times now, but it's great to read the script and find out other details, such as  Frank riding with Teddy alone in the car after the club, although Jimmy was driving, because it explains what happened in the actual script. 

I am sure if people followed the script more it would be a longer movie, but it would leave no questions on what is what.

1nicvs6,As a kid reading LOTR I always wished Aragorn & Sauron met in battle & had a climactic fight. Turns out Peter Jackson had the same idea & actually filmed this very sequence only to replace Sauron with a Cave Troll at the last minute. What do you think of this idea?,0,0.29,22,1758015412.0,True,"Let’s just acknowledge how insanely hard it must be to have your main villain appear as a disembodied eye for 99% of the story. This breaks so many storytelling rules. Yet the fact that Tolkien & especially Jackson, who is dealing with a visual medium & adapting the story for mass audiences, made it work is just…it’d be like never meeting the Emperor in Star Wars. It’s crazy that it works.

But…as a kid? Man I wanted the big bad and our main human hero to fight. I kept hoping for Sauron to appear in physical form at some point in the books(beyond references in appendices). But it wouldn’t really work as well since the books are separated by one half following Aragorn & company and the other half following Frodo and company. 

But the movie? Entirely different beast. We get that incredible prologue with Sauron looking more imposing and badass than I ever imagined as a kid, he’s knocking down foes left and right. Until he…gets his finger cut off in what I can only describe as a major tactical error. Then he goes boom.

And it’s awesome. 

Of course Jackson made many changes from the books. Some say he completely missed the point by not including the Scouring of the Shire. I disagree with that notion, but just so anyone who might discount the idea of Sauron Vs Aragorn out of hand due to it being a major change to source material, keep in mind how different the two are. Faramir is completely different. Arwen is completely different. No Tom Bombadill

So yes, I know, I know. It’s a massive change from the books & I suspect most people will hate it. 

But adult me is still kind of curious about this sequence and think it might’ve been interesting. 

Jackson says he ultimately changed his mind about the fight when he realized the real purpose of the final march on the Black Gates was more about distracting Sauron and drawing his lands out than a 1 on 1 Vs Aragorn and Sauron. 

But I think having Sauron show up in physical form accomplishes that exact same goal. Plus it adds an extra bit of tension and dramatic weight to what is ultimately a fairly tame and forgettable battle(compared to the previous ones we’ve seen). Having Sauron possibly about to win and kill Aragorn when the ring is finally destroyed, causing a repeat of the shockwave effect we saw in the prologue? It would’ve been cool. Maybe. Having Sauron finally show up, in his true form, at the 11th hour, just as our heroes at their most vulnerable? I can see it working. 

Some might say it would take away from Frodo’s story but I don’t think so. The final film is still cutting away from Frodo to Aragorn & company. And Frodo ultimately succeeding(well…knocking Gollum over) still results in the same end. 

So. Could this have worked? Yay? Nay?",movies

1niborp,"I watched Se7en and I liked it, but not as much as other people seem to? (Spoilers)",0,0.32,20,1758010791.0,True,"Hello! I've watched Se7en just now for the first time. I basically knew nothing about it going in, and I'm one of the people that don't really watch too many movies. However, I have seen Fight Club and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I thought they were very thought provoking movies. 

I liked Se7en. In fact, I found the cinematography grabbing. The colors, set design, and just every place felt alive. And it was awesome to look at. In fact, I was surprised this movie was *before* Fight Club, just because Fight Club always felt so raw and this movie felt so much more refined in the scenes. Though, I obviously get that the point of Fight Club is to be that ""raw"". 

I liked the characters and the setting. Somerset was a good character, and Mills is executed very well. I liked that for a large part of the movie, the focus was on the town being ""rotten"", so to speak. I loved how the town always felt like it was raining.

But I didn't really feel like the movie was as much of a masterpiece as everyone said. It's definitely a good movie. I really enjoy these parts... but unlike with Fight Club or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I don't see what ""elevates"" it to beyond. 

The story felt like it was the weakest part of the movie, to me. I'm not sure how to say this, but I feel like it had a different goal from what the rest of the movie suggested to me. In some parts of the movie, it tries to touch on the subject of the philosophy of evil, but I feel like ""tries"" is the key word here. It doesn't do it. It feels kind of like a hanging thread in the movie and that's a little irritating to me. The murders... hmmm, I'm not sure, but they felt a little unrelated to the city's uncaringness, or the change for the worse that it became... I get that the murderer is doing this because of his issues with the city as well, but the problem is that we dont know the victims nor what they really did. It just feels much more judgemental for me for some reason. I feel like the city should have been touched upon much more in my opinion, as that would have given it a more prominent place in my mind. 

I thought the end twist was definitely well done (huge spoilers) >!and in that it was linked to the town because of Tracey's dislike of this place has huge meaning in my opinion. But it still felt... I'm not sure, a little lackluster. Because what killed her is basically someone which the movie tries to portray as another person who thinks this town is getting worse. Or at least, I think it is.!<

I dont know if I'm missing something, but it feels like it's missing a few things that could elevate it to something that really does feel timeless to me, but watching it right now... I'm either missing something, or it just feels like a good movie. I've seen a couple people emphasizing how great this was in the 90s, and I feel like I have to agree. I definitely understand why it would be considered so good then. 

Ultimately I think the biggest issues in the movie that I keep getting mildly irritated by are firstly: how surface level it's attempted ""analysis"" of evil is. Secondly: how only tangentially related most of the latter part of the movie feels in comparison to the beginning movie (the focus on the town's crime at first, the detective's uncomfort with it, his past love... only for the movie to only focus on *one* crime, one *evil* person in its ""analysis for evil"" who says really vague and obviously contradictory things, john doe: ""i'm not special, my work is"" -> ""i was chosen"" yet never pointed out by the two detectives, abandoning all of the town by the end despite it being the big theme). It feels like it missed out on capitalising on all the narrative pieces. 

I don't mean to make less of this movie. It's definitely still interesting. I probably missed a lot of things in my first watch, so a rewatch hopefully will change my opinion on this. If you enjoy the movie, that's amazing, and please don't think my criticisms are attempts to take the magic out of it, but just a perspective of a person who's largely ignorant to movies and only recently started watching them.

I'm just interested in whether other people can understand my point of view, here. The movie felt far too surface level to me, is my entire problem, I guess.",movies

Those are the only two of his movies that I’ve seen and I didn’t know he existed before seeing Hereditary for the first time. And it’s not that I think that either movie is poorly made either. Quite the opposite. The care and attention to detail that he puts into every single scene is obvious. I’ve watched several breakdowns of both movies and read and listened to every discussion or talk he’s given about them that I can find. I’ve really tried to understand these movies as much as I could to see if I could find the link that I’m missing between knowing that these movies are brilliant, and enjoying them. 

Aster has described Hereditary several times as a ritual sacrifice from the point of view of the lamb. This is also very true of Midsommar. In both movies, our point of view characters are doomed from the beginning and there is nothing that they could have done to free themselves from it. Midsommar takes a little while for this to be the case, but as soon as the group arrive at the commune, none of them were ever going to leave. And I think this is why I don’t find these stories to be compelling. At first I was very invested in Annie’s story in Hereditary and Dani’s in Midsommar, but as soon as I realized that their fates were completely out of their hands that investment was lost. “Why should I care what the characters do if I know it won’t matter,” I thought. 

How these movies are structured flies in the face of how I understand movies to work. I have never seen a movie, let alone a horror movie, where our protagonists actions truly didn’t matter. Ripley, MacReady, Sarah Connor, Laurie Strode. None of the main characters from the great horror movies were ever truly doomed from the moment they first met their various aliens or things or terminators or Michael Meyerses. The monster was always stronger but never all-powerful, and death was always likely for our hero(ine) but never certain. They always had a chance to survive, and watching them struggle to hold onto that chance is where the tension came from. It’s why we watched. To see if they would make it or if bad luck or a bad choice meant that they wouldn’t. But for Hereditary and Midsommar, there was never any possibility of the secretive groups orchestrating events in both movies not getting their way. It was like watching a line of perfectly aligned dominoes fall and asking me to be invested in the last domino’s heroic struggle to remain upright. I just couldn’t feel it for these movies, and that’s a shame because I really wish I could.",movies

1ngi7z2,"30 years later, ""Now and Then"" holds up as a testament to girlhood",178,0.86,14,1757825403.0,True,"This is such a solid movie about girlhood and its influence on messy, complicated adulthood. I first saw this movie when I was the age of the younger cast (the ""Then"" group), and now I'm closer in age to the ""Now"" cast. Everything resonated about their reunion in their thirties -- from the awkward conversations, the guilt of not being around each other often, and then the hospital scene with the baby delivery. The back-and-forth narrative really holds up in showing how the girls' last summer before they drifted apart really planted seeds for their complicated adult lives: 

* Chrissy (Ashleigh Ashton Moore, Rita Wilson), the most cautious and naive of the friends but also curious about 'the birds and the bees,' is the one who doesn't leave the neighborhood and marries her high school sweetheart. She's also the first of the friends to have a baby;
* Teeny (Thora Birch, Melanie Griffith) is obsessed with movies and her body image; she later becomes a celebrated actress who experiments with breast augmentation; 
* Samantha (Gaby Hoffmann, Demi Moore) goes through it - her parents divorce, she almost drowns, her interest in the occult gets sidelined during their last seance scene. She finds refuge in science fiction writing, but struggles with being vulnerable; 
* Roberta (Christina Ricci, Rosie O'Donnell) is still grieving her mother's death; as an ob-gyn, older Roberta helps shepherd her best friend (Chrissy) safely into motherhood. Both Ricci and O'Donnell said the character was initially written as a lesbian, but some of the context was written out last minute due to test audience feedback--  however, it would have been compelling to keep the queer context in for the character, considering her 1970s arc (taping her chest, pretending to drown to see if her friends would perform CPR, disinterest in Devon Sawa for most of the movie, etc). 

I know Christina Ricci is now in Yellowjackets (which is also about a 90s group of girls in a back-and-forth timeline, but add cannibalism) but I could seriously see ""Now and Then"" being the premise for a limited series -- think ""This is Us"" crossed with ""Big Little Lies."" ",movies

1nhvatz,"I didn't like ""The Red Shoes"" (1948) and I struggle with it because as a film, I can't say almost anything bad about it.",0,0.29,7,1757963985.0,True,"Everything about ""The Red Shoes"" is polished, magnificently produced. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is otherwordly. The ballet sequence is riveting. Whenever dance was the focus, I was marveled. 

I also must offer praise for Anton Wallbrook. What a chic male. How come he isn't talked about more? I was also mesmerized by his work in ""Gaslight"" and I'm interested in exploring his work.

Yet I didn't like ""The Red Shoes"". It didn't leave the major impression I got from ""Black Narcissus""- 

Two problems I did have with the film were Marius Goring and Moira Shearer. 

With Goring, I found his character, Julian Craster, unlikable. The way he handles Victoria in the last act, by essentially blackmailing her, was unbecoming. Why couldn't he wait? Why the timetable? He also comes off as a doddering middle-aged male preying on a young girl who's starting out. He didn't understand her sacrifice, he made it about himself. 

I know Lermontov was a shady character, however we're supposed to see Lermontov as a bad guy and Lermontov's logic was he knew he could never get Victoria to be completely dedicated if sharing marriage and dancing. In a way, he had a point. Even if he might have had an ulterior motive. 

Moira Shearer was a brilliant dancer and a decent actress, however, what I was struck by was how underwritten her character was. We don't see a lot of Victoria as a person. The narrative is more driven by the rivalry between Lermontov and Julian, while Victoria is left out as the object of the debate. Her voice isn't explored enough. I wanted to know more about Victoria and aside from her passion for dancing and Julian, she's a cipher. Her mom virtually vanishes after the 1st act. 

I wish Victoria had been more present as a character is what I'm saying.",movies

I don't know if they're saying this to make me mad or because they genuinely think Interstellar is predictable but please everyone respond to me.

My friends know how much I love Interstellar, I always rave about it. Today my friend says “it was predictable.” I lost my SHIT! What do you mean Interstellar is predictable?! I genuinely thought she was saying that to make me upset (ragebait) but she was serious! I ask other friends if they also thought it was predictable and they agreed. My original friend said that she knew “the ghost” was Cooper. She explained Murphy pleading to Cooper not to leave, the sand falling from the ceiling, gave it all away. I think she’s full of crap! There is no absolute way one would’ve guessed “Oh yeah that sand falling, the morse code, 100% Cooper from another dimension.” It’s insane. Or am I just dumb? I want to know, did others genuinely predict it?

I told her that she probably saw some Tiktok edits or someone subconsciously spoiled it for her so she was able to connect the dots. Someone going completely blind into Interstellar would’ve not been able to predict it at all!

Anyway, today all my friends were claiming it was predictable and my blood started to boil. So does anyone else agree that it’s pretty unpredictable?!?!?

EDIT: omg. everyone. (they’re not rage baiting. my one friend gave her solid reasonings.) and oh my gosh im not mad or upset that they didn’t like interstellar. i don’t care! what enrages me is calling it “predictable.” also the point of this post wasn’t to make me feel better about my love for interstellar but i wanted to GENUINELY see if others thought it was predictable. especially in the murphys room scenes. did those scenes make you predict that the ghost was cooper?

1nhsllx,Oscars robbery opinions,0,0.14,26,1757958073.0,True,"Hi everyone. 

So I wanna cause a little bit of controversy lol and talk about personal opinions I have on oscar robberies I have 4 main ones which I will list but I wanna know yours too. 


1: Tom Hanks over Liam Nelson. 

Right let me first say I liked Philadelphia it is a great film but let's be real tom hanks over Liam Nelson for Schindler's list for best actor? Definitely not look tom hanks did a good role but anybody could of played it really, when I watch that film I don't see Andrew Beckett I see just tom hanks playing a man with aids, now Liam Nelson I see him only as Oscar Schindler, he made me cry he literally became the character and imo was robbed 

2: Mikey Madison over Demi Moore. 

This is a recent one but I can't lie even after the oscars I watched both films back to back and honestly I feel demibwas robbed she made me feel emotional for her character especially the date scene were she was getting ready, look I like Mikey but all she really did was put on a Brooklyn accent imo and that's not enough, I feel demi played her character better but you know the oscars hates a horror. 

3: Crash winning over Brokeback Mountain. 

Where do I begin one is a classic film which has been preserved in the national library for cultural significance whilst the other is a film which has been forgotten to time, my own dad said crash was his favourite film so I watched it but it didn't work for me it starts a story but doesn't end the story like so keeps starting stories with no real conclusion and whilst I don't think it is bad film etc but to win over Brokeback and even capote? Nope can't agree. 

4: NCFOM over There Will Be Blood. 

Look first of all both are great films I enjoyed them both but imo There Will Be Blood is the best film this century it is literally a perfect masterpiece, after the oscars when they did a list of best films this century and used the ranking based on critics score around the world There Will Be Blood finished. 3rd and NCFOM finished like 8th or 9th, again it's a good film but better film than There Will Be Blood definitely nope

1nh499c,Examples of period-piece movies set in a specific year that only casually establish it?,2,0.53,15,1757887250.0,True,"Most period pieces, if set in a specific year, usually have that year superimposed on-screen at the beginning of the film or have a character/narrator say it right off the bat. I'm looking for examples where you have to be paying closer attention to find out.

Two clear ones off the top of my head:

- *No Country For Old Men* wasn't really advertized as a period piece, until Anton Chigurgh mentions that the 1958 quarter he flipped ""has been travelling for 22 years"" to arrive in that time and place. I remember being surprised doing the mental math in the theater and realizing that the film was set in 1980 and not present-day 2007.

- *The Talented Mr. Ripley* is more obviously set in the past, but I could still see someone not realizing it and just assuming all the suits and ties and vinyl records and old-money hairstyles and ship-travel are because it's set in the world of very blue-blooded Long Islanders and/or coastal Italian fishing towns, until Tom silently writes a letter with a date in January 1959 written at the top like a half-hour into the film.

It has stellar music (sorry;)), great visuals, I can feel the tension in several scenes, especially the rotating ship part in space. Still, I am just not that moved by it. My working theory is that I am not invested enough in the characters? For example, when Cooper is crying over the videoes of his daughter growing up, I can appreciate Matthew’s great performance, but I just don’t feel it.

1nhmcdr,Inglourious Basterds 2013 fan theory,0,0.21,9,1757944093.0,True,"So in the movie there are actually 2 separate plots to kill Hitler, one which is to lock the doors and set the theatre on fire, and the other to send an elite allied squad into the building.

My theory: Hans Landa planned the first plot. His encounter with Shoshanna in the cafe terrified her, but his purpose there was to implant an idea inside her head: that all the top leadership of the nazi party would be in her theatre, and that they would solely be in her hands. Then he encounters a problem that nearly ruins everything: the allies sent a separate team, and they got themselves killed in a really messy way. If their plot was found, the screening would surely be cancelled.

Somehow the movie screening goes forth and he finds out the author of the clumsy plot, Bridget von Hammersmarck, his rival for the reward he seeks, which for her, is honor and glory, (from his perspective) and for him would be a way out of what would later be known as the Nuremberg trials. Enraged by her rivalry and foolishness,  he strangles her and captures the basterds in order to co-opt them into his own plot.

There are some holes in this theory of course, the biggest being how would he be able to leverage Shoshanna’s sacrifice into his bargaining tool. But I want to know what do you think?",movies
1nhxdvp,Another Round sucks I'm sorry,0,0.09,15,1757968571.0,True,"
I've been listening to people recommend me Another Round for a very long time. A huge number of people I know named that movie as one of their top ten favourites. I added it to my watchlist but eventually forgot about it. Decided to finally watch it last night, to see what everyone likes it so much and I was disappointed, to say the least. I get why people like the movie. It has its charms definitely. But these charms won't make me overlook a good number of flaws. Let's start with the fact that there's no way for me to believe that four full grown adults, whether they're in a mid life crisis or not, whether they're depressed or not, will try and test out Skarderud's theory without any hesitation and without any awareness of the consequences. Especially Martin, that obviously isn't as much of a drinker as the other three. Second thing: they don't want to get caught but at the same time they barely try to even cover up what they're doing- Martin casually makes drinking jokes in front of an entire class, Tommy carelessly leaves bottles and flasks at the gym, and Peter casually tells Sebastian that he should sometimes have a drink before taking an exam. And they all do this at the very beginning of an experiment. Totally careless. If you're gonna do something stupid at least be smart about doing something stupid. Characters lack depth- what we know about them gets told, not shown, like when Martin asks Anika if he's become boring but we don't SEE the way he bores her, or Peter constantly yapping about being lonely because he's not married but we never see him actually being lonely. The only character shown as lonely is Tommy, when we find out that he lives alone with his dog in SECOND HALF OF THE FILM. We see so much scenes of Martin's and Tommy's classes but we barely see Peter and Nikolaj teaching their students. Martin's and Nikolaj's wives and children are merely sillouethes. We never find out why are their marriages like that, we never find out why did the main character's marriage fall apart. Anika confessing that she is seeing someone else could have made a great conflict between her and Martin but instead of taking the maximum out of that conflict, they make Martin flip the table like a fucking baby and then they brush it off for the rest of the movie completely. Like they literally leave it at that. Not to mention how much of a loser Martin really is- you need alcohol to have sex with your wife? You need alcohol to take your family on a kayaking trip once in a while? You need alcohol to take any effort into teaching kids? My both parents are highschool teachers- what makes a good teacher isn't just a degree. It's ACTUALLY PUTTING IN EFFORT to understand each kid and to make them interested in what you teach them. And they were unable to do this without drinking everyday? To me, these characters seem like pathetic people who can't do anything properly without being drunk. I know alcohol gives you self confidence but you really don't need it to be interesting. If you need it to be interesting then you're just a coward that is afraid to use their charisma when sober. Not to mention that Tommy dies and then a few hours later Martin is out there dancing at a graduation party. Like your friend just died. That day. And Peter dating that woman, well it gets just briefly mentioned to somehow give closure to his issue. Pure laziness. I'm not even gonna talk about the montage sequence of drunken politicians because it makes no sense. ""Look even politicians drink and they still rule the world"". Yes and not only do they drink, they snort coke everynight and they're also insane psychos. 
This movie had so much potential, it's sad that everything was done so loosely. ",movies
1nh52og,Faster (2010),1,0.53,1,1757889329.0,True,"I’m reminded why this was one of my favorite movies

Upon rewatch, some choices seem over stylized and somewhat corny only really if your nitpicking

Aside from that I’m reminded why this movie really worked for me 

Having come to appreciate breaking bad as a “neo western” or modern western 

I can draw similar comparisons here that I hadn’t realized before 

This is a modern western.
You’ve got the gunslingers and outlaws in the form of a professional contract killer and an ex convict that’s on a war path of vengeance

An old western trope

Again, if your looking too far into the movie you might find some moments corny

Personally some choices are trying too hard 

Like “Driver” (The Rock) having classic car Chevelle as a get away car that’s definitely going to see a few dents and bullet holes

And a black leather jacket that he immediately puts on in 90-100 degree weather

Overstylized, his getaway car doesn’t need to be a chevelle and he doesn’t need that leather jacket 

It’s overkill, but still pulls off that bad ass factor. It works still.

The contract killer confuses me a bit, a software developer sold his company and became rich? Ok

That same software developer decided to become a super assassin?

When you think about it, it doesn’t make a lot of sense 

But it doesn’t really matter

He’s an overachiever that seems to excel at anything he does, he’s an adrenaline junky and is a contract killer for fun. For the love of the game and this is another bad ass that’s in the chase after the “Driver” 

That’s the point. To be bad ass

The “Cop” is an interesting character and not a stereotypical good guy cop

He’s a drug addict, has a shady history, is trying to repair his relationship with his ex wife while trying to be a father and a detective that is hot on the trail of the carnage left behind of these two outlaws 

Won’t spoil the twist but I have to say I’m not a fan of it.

Ultimately not a fan of how it ended. 

But ultimately I think this movie serves as a fun, slick guilty pleasure with interesting characters.

Also everything seems to come full circle as if nothing was done for no reason.

Who hired the assassin? 
Why?
Why is Driver listening to a sermon in the car?
Why does the assassin have 1$ bills on his wall?
All these questions are answered

1ngiro8,Don Bluth - what specific things stand out to you the most about his iconic art style?,22,0.72,15,1757827345.0,True,"Foe me, it is movement. His characters have a ton of movement. Every part of their bodies (and clothing) move so beautifully and fluid. When you see Fievel scramble around, every limb, every digit, is moving and scrambling with what feels like more frames than other movies. Like there is a lot less smearing between frames it feels. 

This goes double for their faces. The mouths especially. Don's characters seem to move their mouths, jaws, and tongues more than other characters. You'd see them licking their lips, sticking tongues out a lot, see the tongues moving as they talk and eunciate (spelling) and the lower lip curls (which I always associate with his style) during specifoc syllables. 

What do you associate when you think of his art style?

1nh3s1r,A Hypothesis on the Alien Encounter in Contact,0,0.48,2,1757886070.0,True,"The famous “first contact” scene in Contact is usually framed through Ellie’s perspective — confusion, awe, and vulnerability. But if we shift the lens to the alien’s side, a different story emerges: this encounter looks less like a welcoming embrace and more like a cosmic job interview politely ending in a rejection letter.

The Alien’s Strategy

By taking the form of Ellie’s father, the alien wasn’t just being compassionate — it was also testing. This was a stress test designed to see how a human would handle raw emotion when confronted with the incomprehensible. In essence, Ellie was placed in a situation where humanity’s honesty, fragility, and character were on full display.

When Ellie pressed about whether it was a test, the alien’s quick “No” felt less like truth and more like damage control — the only moment it betrayed nervousness. Just as a recruiter doesn’t want to admit you’re being judged during a casual chat, the alien avoided shattering the fragile trust it had just established.

Humanity as the Candidate

Ellie wasn’t a diplomat, a general, or a philosopher. She was “just human.” That’s the point: humanity didn’t send a rehearsed representative, but someone authentic. What the alien witnessed was both the good side of humanity (curiosity, yearning, capacity for connection) and the bad side (division, immaturity, violence).

This duality made Ellie incapable of “passing” the test — because no individual could ever represent all of humanity’s contradictions. Her awe and stumbling honesty revealed that we’re still a long way from being a stable, unified civilization.

The Rejection Letter

The alien’s message boils down to: “You’re not ready.” Yet this rejection wasn’t cruel. Instead of closing the door, it framed the encounter as a “first step.” Like a recruiter telling a candidate: “Not now, but we see potential — keep working, maybe later.”

The aliens recognize promise, but they also see danger. To them, patience might span thousands of years. To us, it feels like a bittersweet cliffhanger.

Why This Matters

Most interpretations of the scene lean toward a “humble test” — the idea that the aliens are simply easing us in. That reading is safe and hopeful. But when you look closely, the encounter reads more like a rejection softened with compassion. Humanity isn’t being invited into the galactic community just yet — we’re being told to grow up first.

In short: the scene isn’t just about wonder; it’s about judgment. It’s less a handshake, more a performance review. And the verdict was: not ready yet.",movies

1nft1ki,What are the weirdest big-budget movies ever made?,751,0.89,516,1757755264.0,True,"
The weirdest one I know of is *Batman Returns*. It had a budget of $50 Million in 1992, which would be about $117 Million in today’s dollars. Most of the imagery is deliberately offputting. The penguin murders children and shoves a whole dead fish into his mouth. Catwoman dresses in BDSM gear. Back when superhero movies were primarily for kids, Tim Burton made one that was not for kids. 

Has anybody made a weirder movie at that scale?

1ngay3i,Do movie studios not advertise movies as much as they used to?,60,0.72,71,1757803307.0,True,"When my parents told me they saw the new ""Downton Abbey"" movie today, I responded, ""Wait, there's a new Downton Abbey movie out? When the hell did this happen? This is literally the first time I'm hearing about this."" And it's true; prior to today, I hadn't seen a single advertisement for it anywhere. In fact, this is something I'm seeing more frequently nowadays; I'll hear about a movie that just came out in theaters that I didn't even know was coming out.

It was way different back in the '90s when I was a kid. I pretty much knew EVERY movie that was coming out and when it was coming out because I would see tons of ads on TV and in the paper in the months leading up to its release. This was especially true for Disney; when ""The Lion King"" came out in 1994, you literally couldn't go ANYWHERE without seeing it advertised. If you turned on the radio, there was Elton John singing ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight."" If you went to Toys 'R' Us, there would be Lion King toys EVERYWHERE. If you wanted to get a chocolate bar, there you'd find a special Lion King Nestle bar (I can still taste them).

Fast forward to 2025 and I find out there's a new Disney movie through an Alex Meyers video. Literally no advertisement or buzz leading up to its release.

So what's going on here? Did the streaming age and/or COVID change the way studios advertise upcoming movies? Or do algorithms only show us ads for movies they think we want to see?",movies

1nhyqj7,Alien (1979) felt pretty underwhelming,0,0.12,91,1757971718.0,True,"So, I just watched *Alien* (1979), and honestly I came out pretty disappointed.  
First off, I should clarify that I’m not someone who needs constant action in a film (in fact, the part I enjoyed the least was when the crew was being chased by the Xenomorph). I also get that it was groundbreaking at the time, and the fact that it turned out the way it did despite the technical limitations is definitely a plus in my appreciation. I just don’t see how that automatically makes it a great piece of cinema, let alone “the greatest of all time” as some people claim.

The acting is, at best, passable. The character development is basically nonexistent, and the buildup, which seems to be the main argument fans use to defend it, felt underwhelming and poorly paced to me, especially when you’ve got one of the best monster designs ever, in my opinion.

I was genuinely impressed at the start with the discovery of the ship, the facehugger, the Nostromo’s design, and the atmosphere. But once the Xenomorph showed up, the film completely lost me.

Ripley is a solid character, especially considering the significance of having a female lead at the time, but she has to carry the whole story on her own given how underdeveloped the rest of the cast is.

In the end, the only truly outstanding aspects for me were the atmosphere, the concept of the Xenomorph on paper, and H. R. Giger’s phenomenal design work.

Thing is, I usually love Ridley Scott’s work, so I’m kind of sad about this. Do you think I should still give the rest of the series a shot, especially since so many different directors worked on it, or is it just not for me?",movies

I really love a lot of aspects of the first predator movie, the real authentic feel, the potential for intense suspense that runs throughout a majority of the screentime, less dialogue, more silence, an incredibly dangerous antagonist, and a grand majestic setting like the jungles of central America. Could be variations of these elements but please recommend similar movies from any era and anywhere in the world.

Fancied himself a film buff and a future filmaker. Had blockbuster and Netflix subscriptions simultaneously for back catalogue stuff. Dove into films as a way to one up people because I was so much better. Fell in love with my wife during a late night game of 6 degrees where we would both name a random actor/ress and the fastest to connect movies between the two the winner. Told my wife I loved her on Oscar night 2004. Trailed off watching films as the young kids came. Owned thousands of DVDs and bluerays, had to sell nearly all of them over the years during lean times. Some of them still hurt, others were easy to let go of. Stoped being a douche, or at least that flavor of douche. Got into fantasy books instead of films and haven't seen much recently - not to say nothing. Still a bit of a film snob.

The Soviet version comes a bit closer, with about an hour more, to Dostoevsky’s thought, but it still lacks the depth of the novel. The 1958 film is a good movie in its own right. Yul Brynner is excellent as Dmitri Karamazov, and I loved Maria Schell as Grushenka. It’s a good drama with a police suspense surrounding the death of Fyodor Karamazov. It doesn’t have the depth of the original material, but that’s not a flaw, as it’s almost impossible to achieve. A television adaptation, like the one from 2009, managed to come closer.

1nhh4nf,I will never understand the slander behind Incredibles 2,0,0.15,7,1757928337.0,True,"With Incredibles 3 announced, it sparked up discussions about the Incredibles franchise, and I was shocked to discover how many people were either disappointed with Incredibles 2 or straight up did not like it. One of the common complaints seems to be that the film is a retread of the first, just that the roles are reversed with Bob being the stay-at-home dad while Helen goes out doing superhero work. Some call this a lazy rehash but I thought it was a clever way to explore the development of Bob as a character, and what it truly means to be a hero. In the first film, he learns the value of putting family first, but in the second film, he learns that being a hero also happens at home, not just on the battlefield. Some say Bob's development was retracted in the sequel, but I personally saw it as him discovering a new element to what it means to being a father. Also, switching the roles of Bob and Helen also works as a nice subversion in the sense that stay-at-home dads aren't as common as stay-at-home moms, so by gender norms alone, this allows for different dynamics to be explored compared to the first film. The film is definitely not as good as Incredibles 1, but I do think Incredibles 2 deserves more credit than people give it credit for, especially in the ""retread"" criticism. But I'm sure many of you will disagree which is perfectly ok! ",movies
